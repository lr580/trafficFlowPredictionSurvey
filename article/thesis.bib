	abstract = {Traffic forecasting is important for the success of intelligent transportation systems. Deep learning models, including convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have been extensively applied in traffic forecasting problems to model spatial and temporal dependencies. In recent years, to model the graph structures in transportation systems as well as contextual information, graph neural networks have been introduced and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a series of traffic forecasting problems. In this survey, we review the rapidly growing body of research using different graph neural networks, e.g. graph convolutional and graph attention networks, in various traffic forecasting problems, e.g. road traffic flow and speed forecasting, passenger flow forecasting in urban rail transit systems, and demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms. We also present a comprehensive list of open data and source codes for each problem and identify future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that explores the application of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting problems. We have also created a public GitHub repository where the latest papers, open data, and source codes will be updated.},

	abstract = {In this modern era, traffic congestion has become a major source of severe negative economic and environmental impact for urban areas worldwide. One of the most efficient ways to mitigate traffic congestion is through future traffic prediction. The research field of traffic prediction has evolved greatly ever since its inception in the late 70s. Earlier studies mainly use classical statistical models such as ARIMA and its variants. Recently, researchers have started to focus on machine learning models because of their power and flexibility. As theoretical and technological advances emerge, we enter the era of deep neural network, which gained popularity due to its sheer prediction power which can be attributed to the complex and deep structure. Despite the popularity of deep neural network models in the field of traffic prediction, literature surveys of such methods are rare. In this work, we present an up-to-date survey of deep neural network for traffic prediction. We will provide a detailed explanation of popular deep neural network architectures commonly used in the traffic flow prediction literatures, categorize and describe the literatures themselves, present an overview of the commonalities and differences among different works, and finally provide a discussion regarding the challenges and future directions for this field.},

Inspired by the domain knowledge of motion prediction, in which the future motion of an object can be predicted based on previous scenes, we propose a network grid representation method that can retain the fine-scale structure of a transportation network. Network-wide traffic speeds are converted into a series of static images and input into a novel deep architecture, namely, spatiotemporal recurrent convolutional networks (SRCNs), for traffic forecasting. The proposed SRCNs inherit the advantages of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The spatial dependencies of network-wide traffic can be captured by DCNNs, and the temporal dynamics can be learned by LSTMs. An experiment on a Beijing transportation network with 278 links demonstrates that SRCNs outperform other deep learning-based algorithms in both short-term and long-term traffic prediction.},

	abstract = {Traffic flow prediction is a fundamental problem in transportation modeling and management. Many existing approaches fail to provide favorable results due to being: 1) shallow in architecture; 2) hand engineered in features; and 3) separate in learning. In this paper we propose a deep architecture that consists of two parts, i.e., a deep belief network (DBN) at the bottom and a multitask regression layer at the top. A DBN is employed here for unsupervised feature learning. It can learn effective features for traffic flow prediction in an unsupervised fashion, which has been examined and found to be effective for many areas such as image and audio classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that applies the deep learning approach to transportation research. To incorporate multitask learning (MTL) in our deep architecture, a multitask regression layer is used above the DBN for supervised prediction. We further investigate homogeneous MTL and heterogeneous MTL for traffic flow prediction. To take full advantage of weight sharing in our deep architecture, we propose a grouping method based on the weights in the top layer to make MTL more effective. Experiments on transportation data sets show good performance of our deep architecture. Abundant experiments show that our approach achieved close to 5\% improvements over the state of the art. It is also presented that MTL can improve the generalization performance of shared tasks. These positive results demonstrate that deep learning and MTL are promising in transportation research.},

Several pioneering approaches have been proposed based on traffic observations of the target location as well as its adjacent regions, but they obtain somewhat limited accuracy due to lack of mining road topology. To address the effect attenuation problem, we propose to take account of the traffic of surrounding locations. We propose an end-to-end framework called DeepTransport, in which Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are utilized to obtain spatial-temporal traffic information within a transport network topology. In addition, attention mechanism is introduced to align spatial and temporal information. Moreover, we constructed and released a real-world large traffic condition dataset with 5-minute resolution. Our experiments on this dataset demonstrate our method captures the complex relationship in both temporal and spatial domain. It significantly outperforms traditional statistical methods and a state-of-the-art deep learning method.},

	abstract = {Deep learning approaches have reached a celebrity status in artificial intelligence field, its success have mostly relied on Convolutional Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Networks. By exploiting fundamental spatial properties of images and videos, the CNN always achieves dominant performance on visual tasks. And the Recurrent Networks (RNN) especially long short-term memory methods (LSTM) can successfully characterize the temporal correlation, thus exhibits superior capability for time series tasks. Traffic flow data have plentiful characteristics on both time and space domain. However, applications of CNN and LSTM approaches on traffic flow are limited. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture combined CNN and LSTM to forecast future traffic flow (CLTFP). An 1-dimension CNN is exploited to capture spatial features of traffic flow, and two LSTMs are utilized to mine the short-term variability and periodicities of traffic flow. Given those meaningful features, the feature-level fusion is performed to achieve short-term forecasting. The proposed CLTFP is compared with other popular forecasting methods on an open datasets. Experimental results indicate that the CLTFP has considerable advantages in traffic flow forecasting. in additional, the proposed CLTFP is analyzed from the view of Granger Causality, and several interesting properties of CLTFP are discovered and discussed .},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the temporal pattern in traffic flow time series, and implement a deep learning model for traffic flow prediction. Detrending based methods decompose original flow series into trend and residual series, in which trend describes the fixed temporal pattern in traffic flow and residual series is used for prediction. Inspired by the detrending method, we propose DeepTrend, a deep hierarchical neural network used for traffic flow prediction which considers and extracts the time-variant trend. DeepTrend has two stacked layers: extraction layer and prediction layer. Extraction layer, a fully connected layer, is used to extract the time-variant trend in traffic flow by feeding the original flow series concatenated with corresponding simple average trend series. Prediction layer, an LSTM layer, is used to make flow prediction by feeding the obtained trend from the output of extraction layer and calculated residual series. To make the model more effective, DeepTrend needs first pre-trained layer-by-layer and then fine-tuned in the entire network. Experiments show that DeepTrend can noticeably boost the prediction performance compared with some traditional prediction models and LSTM with detrending based methods.},

The variable under study is the relative velocity, which is the traffic volume divided by the road occupancy. Although the specification of the network’s neighborhood structure for the STARIMA model was relatively simple and can be further refined, the results obtained indicate a comparable forecasting performance for the ARIMA, VARMA, and STARIMA models.

	abstract = {Short-term traffic forecasting based on deep learning methods, especially long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, has received much attention in recent years. However, the potential of deep learning methods in traffic forecasting has not yet fully been exploited in terms of the depth of the model architecture, the spatial scale of the prediction area, and the predictive power of spatial-temporal data. In this paper, a deep stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM (SBU- LSTM) neural network architecture is proposed, which considers both forward and backward dependencies in time series data, to predict network-wide traffic speed. A bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) layer is exploited to capture spatial features and bidirectional temporal dependencies from historical data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that BDLSTMs have been applied as building blocks for a deep architecture model to measure the backward dependency of traffic data for prediction. The proposed model can handle missing values in input data by using a masking mechanism. Further, this scalable model can predict traffic speed for both freeway and complex urban traffic networks. Comparisons with other classical and state-of-the-art models indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM neural network achieves superior prediction performance for the whole traffic network in both accuracy and robustness.},

Recognising congestion is subjective and is difficult to express such decision making algorithmically. There is also a need for rapid short term prediction. The benefit of a neural network is that it absorbs patterns in data and so can learn to generalise. The main features of a neural network approach, the trials of its application to a congestion recognition problem (based on Leicester SCOOT data), and the trials of short term forecasting of flows (again with SCOOT data) are all described. Included are graphs of predictions made. The paper goes on to discuss whether neural networks can be used to infer parameters not directly measureable on the street. -D.Jarratt},

The approach uses exponential smoothing to preprocess traffic flow data by removing the lumpiness from collected traffic flow data, before employing a variant of the LM algorithm to train the NN weights of an NN model. This approach aids NN training, as the preprocessed traffic flow data are more smooth and continuous than the original unprocessed traffic flow data. The proposed method was evaluated by forecasting short-term traffic flow conditions on the Mitchell freeway in Western Australia. With regard to the generalization capabilities for short-term traffic flow forecasting, the NN models developed using the proposed approach outperform those that are developed based on the alternative tested algorithms, which are particularly designed either for short-term traffic flow forecasting or for enhancing generalization capabilities of NNs.},

	abstract = {Real-time urban traffic speed estimation provides significant benefits in many real-world applications. However, existing traffic information acquisition systems only obtain coarse-grained traffic information on a small number of roads but cannot acquire fine-grained traffic information on every road. To address this problem, in this paper we study the traffic speed estimation problem, which, given a budget K, identifies K roads (called seeds) where the real traffic speeds on these seeds can be obtained using crowdsourcing, and infers the speeds of other roads (called non-seed roads) based on the speeds of these seeds. This problem includes two sub-problems: (1) Speed Inference - How to accurately infer the speeds of the non-seed roads; (2) Seed Selection - How to effectively select high-quality seeds. It is rather challenging to estimate the traffic speed accurately, because the traffic changes dynamically and the changes are hard to be predicted as many possible factors can affect the traffic. To address these challenges, we propose effective algorithms to judiciously select high-quality seeds and devise inference models to infer the speeds of the non-seed roads. On the one hand, we observe that roads have correlations and correlated roads have similar traffic trend: the speeds of correlated roads rise or fall compared with their historical average speed simultaneously. We utilize this property and propose a two-step model to estimate the traffic speed. The first step adopts a graphical model to infer the traffic trend and the second step devises a hierarchical linear model to estimate the traffic speed based on the traffic trend. On the other hand, we formulate the seed selection problem, prove that it is NP-hard, and propose several greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees. Experimental results on two large real datasets show that our method outperforms baselines by 2 orders of magnitude in efficiency and 40\% in estimation accuracy.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Without resets, the state may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is a novel, adaptive “forget gate” that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review illustrative benchmark problems on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve continual versions of these problems.

	abstract = {Traffic information prediction is one of the most essential studies for traffic research, operation and management. The successful prediction of traffic speed is increasingly significant for the benefits of both road users and traffic authorities. However, accurate prediction is challenging, due to the stochastic feature of traffic flow and shallow model structure. Furthermore, environmental factors, such as rainfall influence, should also be incorporated to improve accuracy. Inspired by deep learning, this paper investigates the performance of deep belief network (DBN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to conduct short-term traffic speed prediction with the consideration of rainfall impact as a non-traffic input. The deep learning models have the ability to learn complex features of traffic flow pattern under various rainfall conditions. To validate the performance of rainfall-integrated DBN and LSTM, the traffic detector data from an arterial in Beijing are utilised for model training and testing. The experiment results indicate that with the combination input of speed and additional rainfall data, deep learning models have better prediction accuracy over other existing models, and also yields improvements over the models without rainfall input.

	abstract = {Successful traffic speed prediction is of great importance for the benefits of both road users and traffic management agencies. To solve the problem, traffic scientists have developed a number of time-series speed prediction approaches, including traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. However, existing methods are still unsatisfying due to the difficulty to reflect the stochastic traffic flow characteristics. Recently, various deep learning models have been introduced to the prediction field. In this paper, a deep learning method, the Deep Belief Network (DBN) model, is proposed for short-term traffic speed information prediction. The DBN model is trained in a greedy unsupervised method and fine-tuned by labeled data. Based on traffic speed data collected from one arterial in Beijing, China, the model is trained and tested for different prediction time horizons. From experiment analysis, it is concluded that the DBN can outperform Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for all time horizons. The advantages of DBN indicate that deep learning is promising in traffic research area.},

It becomes particularly challenging due to short-term (e.g., accidents, constructions) and long-term (e.g., peak-hour, seasonal, weather) traffic patterns. While most of the previously proposed techniques focus on normal condition forecasting, a single framework for extreme condition traffic forecasting does not exist. To address this need, we propose to take a deep learning approach. We build a deep neural network based on long short term memory (LSTM) units. We apply Deep LSTM to forecast peak-hour traffic and manage to identify unique characteristics of the traffic data. We further improve the model for post-accident forecasting with Mixture Deep LSTM model. It jointly models the normal condition traffic and the pattern of accidents. We evaluate our model on a real-world large-scale traffic dataset in Los Angeles. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularization, our approach achieves 30\%–50\% improvement over baselines. We also demonstrate a novel technique to interpret the model with signal stimulation. We note interesting observations from the trained neural network.},

	abstract = {Crowd flow prediction is a fundamental urban computing problem. Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to solve this problem, but it relies on rich historical data. In reality, many cities may suffer from data scarcity issue when their targeted service or infrastructure is new. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep spatio-temporal transfer learning framework, called RegionTrans, which can predict future crowd flow in a data-scarce (target) city by transferring knowledge from a data-rich (source) city. Leveraging social network check-ins, RegionTrans first links a region in the target city to certain regions in the source city, expecting that these inter-city region pairs will share similar crowd flow dynamics. Then, we propose a deep spatio-temporal neural network structure, in which a hidden layer is dedicated to keeping the region representation. A source city model is then trained on its rich historical data with this network structure. Finally, we propose a region-based cross-city transfer learning algorithm to learn the target city model from the source city model by minimizing the hidden representation discrepancy between the inter-city region pairs previously linked by check-ins. With experiments on real crowd flow, RegionTrans can outperform state-of-the-arts by reducing up to 10.7\% prediction error.},

	abstract = {Urban flow monitoring systems play important roles in smart city efforts around the world. However, the ubiquitous deployment of monitoring devices, such as CCTVs, induces a long-lasting and enormous cost for maintenance and operation. This suggests the need for a technology that can reduce the number of deployed devices, while preventing the degeneration of data accuracy and granularity. In this paper, we aim to infer the real-time and fine-grained crowd flows throughout a city based on coarse-grained observations. This task is challenging due to the two essential reasons: the spatial correlations between coarse- and fine-grained urban flows, and the complexities of external impacts. To tackle these issues, we develop a method entitled UrbanFM based on deep neural networks. Our model consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs by using a feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the influences of different external factors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on this problem.},

A number of models and algorithms based on time series prediction and machine learning were applied to short-term traffic flow prediction and achieved good results. However, most of the models require the length of the input historical data to be predefined and static, which cannot automatically determine the optimal time lags. To overcome this shortage, a model called Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) is proposed in this paper, which takes advantages of the three multiplicative units in the memory block to determine the optimal time lags dynamically. The dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) is used for building the model and comparing LSTM RNN with several well-known models, such as random walk(RW), support vector machine(SVM), single layer feed forward neural network(FFNN) and stacked autoencoder(SAE). The results show that the proposed prediction model achieves higher accuracy and generalizes well.},

	abstract = {Tracking congestion throughout the network road is a critical component of Intelligent transportation network management systems. Understanding how the traffic flows and short-term prediction of congestion occurrence due to rush-hour or incidents can be beneficial to such systems to effectively manage and direct the traffic to the most appropriate detours. Many of the current traffic flow prediction systems are designed by utilizing a central processing component where the prediction is carried out through aggregation of the information gathered from all measuring stations. However, centralized systems are not scalable and fail provide real-time feedback to the system whereas in a decentralized scheme, each node is responsible to predict its own short-term congestion based on the local current measurements in neighboring nodes. We propose a decentralized deep learning-based method where each node accurately predicts its own congestion state in realtime based on the congestion state of the neighboring stations. Moreover, historical data from the deployment site is not required, which makes the proposed method more suitable for newly installed stations. In order to achieve higher performance, we introduce a regularized euclidean loss function that favors high congestion samples over low congestion samples to avoid the impact of the unbalanced training dataset. A novel dataset for this purpose is designed based on the traffic data obtained from traffic control stations in northern California. Extensive experiments conducted on the designed benchmark reflect a successful congestion prediction.},

To capture the spatial and temporal dependence simultaneously, we propose a novel neural network-based traffic forecasting method, the temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN) model, which is in combination with the graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Specifically, the GCN is used to learn complex topological structures to capture spatial dependence and the gated recurrent unit is used to learn dynamic changes of traffic data to capture temporal dependence. Then, the T-GCN model is employed to traffic forecasting based on the urban road network. Experiments demonstrate that our T-GCN model can obtain the spatio-temporal correlation from traffic data and the predictions outperform state-of-art baselines on real-world traffic datasets.

	abstract = {Spatial-temporal prediction has many applications such as climate forecasting and urban planning. In particular, traffic prediction has drawn increasing attention in data mining research field for the growing traffic related datasets and for its impacts in real-world applications. For example, an accurate taxi demand prediction can assist taxi companies to pre-allocate taxis to meet with commuting demands. The key challenge of traffic prediction lies in how to model the complex spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we make two important observations which have not been considered by previous studies: (1) the spatial dependency between locations are dynamic; and (2) the temporal dependency follows strong periodicity but is not strictly periodic for its dynamic temporal shifting. Based on these two observations, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Network (STDN) framework. In this framework, we propose a flow gating mechanism to learn the dynamic similarity between locations via traffic flow. A periodically shifted attention mechanism is designed to handle long-term periodic dependency and periodic temporal shifting. Furthermore, we extend our framework from region-based traffic prediction to traffic prediction for road intersections by using graph convolutional structure. We conduct extensive experiments on several large-scale real traffic datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Predicting traffic conditions from online route queries is a challenging task as there are many complicated interactions over the roads and crowds involved. In this paper, we intend to improve traffic prediction by appropriate integration of three kinds of implicit but essential factors encoded in auxiliary information. We do this within an encoder-decoder sequence learning framework that integrates the following data: 1) offline geographical and social attributes. For example, the geographical structure of roads or public social events such as national celebrations; 2) road intersection information. In general, traffic congestion occurs at major junctions; 3) online crowd queries. For example, when many online queries issued for the same destination due to a public performance, the traffic around the destination will potentially become heavier at this location after a while. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on a real-world dataset from Baidu have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework.},

	abstract = {Recently, traffic prediction based on deep learning methods has attracted much attention. However, there still exist two major challenges, namely, dynamic spatio-temporal dependences among network-wide links and long-term traffic prediction for the next few hours. To address these two challenges, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal attentive neural network (STANN) for the network-wide and long-term traffic prediction. The STANN captures the spatial–temporal dependences based on the encoder–decoder architecture with the attention mechanisms. In the encoder, the STANN learns the spatio-temporal dependences from historical traffic series using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, in which a new spatial attention model is developed to consider the contribution of each link to the network-wide prediction. In the decoder, the STANN exploits another RNN with LSTM units and a temporal attention model to select the relevant and important historical spatio-temporal dependences from the encoder for long-term traffic prediction. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate STANN on three real-world traffic datasets. The experimental results show that the STANN is significantly better than other state-of-the-art models.},

	abstract = {Predicting urban traffic is of great importance to intelligent transportation systems and public safety, yet is very challenging because of two aspects: 1) complex spatio-temporal correlations of urban traffic, including spatial correlations between locations along with temporal correlations among timestamps; 2) diversity of such spatio-temporal correlations, which vary from location to location and depend on the surrounding geographical information, e.g., points of interests and road networks. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep-meta-learning based model, entitled ST-MetaNet, to collectively predict traffic in all location at once. ST-MetaNet employs a sequence-to-sequence architecture, consisting of an encoder to learn historical information and a decoder to make predictions step by step. In specific, the encoder and decoder have the same network structure, consisting of a recurrent neural network to encode the traffic, a meta graph attention network to capture diverse spatial correlations, and a meta recurrent neural network to consider diverse temporal correlations. Extensive experiments were conducted based on two real-world datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of ST-MetaNet beyond several state-of-the-art methods.},

Attention-based models have emerged in recent years, mostly in the field of natural language processing, and have resulted in major progresses in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. This inspires us to introduce the application of attentions for traffic flow prediction. In this study, a deep learning based traffic flow predictor with spatial and temporal attentions (STANN) is proposed. The spatial and temporal attentions are used to exploit the spatial dependencies between road segments and temporal dependencies between time steps respectively. Experiment results with a real-world traffic dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model. The results also show that the utilization of multiple data resolutions could help improve prediction accuracy.

	abstract = {Accurate speed predictions for urban roads are highly important for traffic monitoring and route planning, and also help relieve the pressure of traffic congestion. Many existing studies on traffic speed prediction are based on convolutional neural networks, and these have primarily focused on capturing the spatial proximity among different road segments. However, the real cause of the spread of traffic congestion is the connectivity of these road segments, rather than their spatial proximity. This makes it very challenging to improve prediction accuracy. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), the connectivity of these road segments can be modeled as a graph in which the properties of road segments and the connections between them are embedded as the properties of the nodes and edges, respectively. This paper describes a novel approach that combines the advantages of sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models and GNNs. Specifically, the evolution of traffic conditions on road networks is modeled as a sequence of graphs. Thus, the proposed SeqGNN model represents both the inputs and outputs as graph sequences. Finally, the extensive experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over the state-of-the-art methods.},

To promote the forecast accuracy, a feasible way is to develop a more effective approach for traffic data analysis. The availability of abundant traffic data and computation power emerge in recent years, which motivates us to improve the accuracy of short-term traffic forecast via deep learning approaches. A novel traffic forecast model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed. Different from conventional forecast models, the proposed LSTM network considers temporal?spatial correlation in traffic system via a two-dimensional network which is composed of many memory units. A comparison with other representative forecast models validates that the proposed LSTM network can achieve a better performance.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a deep learning approach for traffic flow prediction in complex road networks. Traffic flow data from induction loop sensors are essentially a time series, which is also spatially related to traffic in different road segments. The spatio-temporal traffic data can be converted into an image where the traffic data are expressed in a 3D space with respect to space and time axes. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been showing surprising performance in understanding images, they have a major drawback. In the max pooling operation, CNNs are losing important information by locally taking the highest activation values. The inter-relationship in traffic data measured by sparsely located sensors in different time intervals should not be neglected in order to obtain accurate predictions. Thus, we propose a neural network with capsules that replaces max pooling by dynamic routing. This is the first approach that employs the capsule network on a time series forecasting problem, to our best knowledge. Moreover, an experiment on real traffic speed data measured in the Santander city of Spain demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method based on a CNN by 13.1\% in terms of root mean squared error.},

	abstract = {Traffic speed prediction is a long-standing and critically important topic in the area of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Recent years have witnessed the encouraging potentials of deep neural networks for real-life applications of various domains. Traffic speed prediction, however, is still in its initial stage without making full use of spatio-temporal traffic information. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a deep learning method with an Error-feedback Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network structure (eRCNN) for continuous traffic speed prediction. By integrating the spatio-temporal traffic speeds of contiguous road segments as an input matrix, eRCNN explicitly leverages the implicit correlations among nearby segments to improve the predictive accuracy. By further introducing separate error feedback neurons to the recurrent layer, eRCNN learns from prediction errors so as to meet predictive challenges rising from abrupt traffic events such as morning peaks and traffic accidents. Extensive experiments on real-life speed data of taxis running on the 2nd and 3rd ring roads of Beijing city demonstrate the strong predictive power of eRCNN in comparison to some state-of-the-art competitors. The necessity of weight pre-training using a transfer learning notion has also been testified. More interestingly, we design a novel influence function based on the deep learning model, and showcase how to leverage it to recognize the congestion sources of the ring roads in Beijing.},

	abstract = {We develop an effective approach for non-linear and non-periodic traffic speed prediction on urban road networks, featuring convolutional neural networks enhanced by feature selections based on traffic flow dynamics. The prediction models we construct use convolutional neural network for the recognition of the spatio-temporal patterns of potentially congested (thus highly fluctuating) urban traffic. More importantly, a specially designed cone-shaped binary mask in the space-time domain is used to select relevant input features, both for trainings and for predictions. The design of the mask is based on the domain knowledge of the state-of-the-art traffic theories, which characterise the universal features on how perturbations to the road traffic propagate in space-time, based on the non-linear vehicle-to-vehicle interactions resulting from individual human driver responses to the environment. We test our models with empirical sensory data collected from highways in the city state of Singapore, with the aim of predicting traffic speed during peak hours. In addition to an average improvement of prediction accuracy from 0.9\% to 3.3\% for highly fluctuating road segments given different prediction horizons from 5 minutes to 20 minutes, we can achieve up to 23.8\% improvement in accuracy for individual road segment, compared with the best results for applying state-of-art models. Results demonstrate that the proposed convolutional neural networks with masks can capture the non-linear spatio-temporal traffic dynamics and also provide accurate short-term traffic speed prediction at time with sudden changes of traffic conditions.},

For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region. Experiments on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and New York City (NYC) demonstrate that the proposed ST-ResNet outperforms six well-known methods.},

Existing approaches are either based on estimating the time cost of each road segment which are not able to capture many cross-segment complex factors, or designed heuristically in a non-learning-based way which fail to utilize the existing abundant temporal labels of the data, i.e., the time stamp of each trajectory point. In this paper, we leverage on new development of deep neural networks and propose a novel auxiliary supervision model, namely DeepTravel, that can automatically and effectively extract different features, as well as make full use of the temporal labels of the trajectory data.

	abstract = {Recent analyses (Bengio, Delalleau, \& Le Roux, 2006; Bengio \& Le Cun, 2007) of modern nonparametric machine learning algorithms that are kernel machines, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), graph-based manifold and semi-supervised learning algorithms suggest fundamental limitations of some learning algorithms. The problem is clear in kernel-based approaches when the kernel is "local" (e.g., the Gaussian kernel), i.e., K (x, y ) converges to a constant when {\textbar}{\textbar}x - y {\textbar}{\textbar} increases. These analyses point to the difficulty of learning "highly-varying functions", i.e., functions that have a large number of "variations" in the domain of interest, e.g., they would require a large number of pieces to be well represented by a piecewise-linear approximation. Since the number of pieces can be made to grow exponentially with the number of factors of variations in the input, this is connected with the well-known curse of dimensionality for classical non-parametric learning algorithms (for regression, classification and density estimation). If the shapes of all these pieces are unrelated, one needs enough examples for each piece in order to generalize properly. However, if these shapes are related and can be predicted from each other, "non-local" learning algorithms have the potential to generalize to pieces not covered by the training set. Such ability would seem necessary for learning in complex domains such as Artificial Intelligence tasks (e.g., related to vision, language, speech, robotics). Kernel machines (not only those with a local kernel) have a shallow architecture, i.e., only two levels of data-dependent computational elements. This is also true of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer (which can become SVMs when the number of hidden units becomes large (Bengio, Le Roux, Vincent, Delalleau, \& Marcotte, 2006)). A serious problem with shallow architectures is that they can be very inefficient in terms of the number of computational units (e.g., bases, hidden units), and thus in terms of required examples (Bengio \& Le Cun, 2007). One way to represent a highly-varying function compactly (with few parameters) is through the composition of many non-linearities, i.e., with a deep architecture. For example, the parity function with d inputs requires O(2d ) examples and parameters to be represented by a Gaussian SVM (Bengio et al., 2006), O(d2 ) parameters for a one-hidden-layer neural network, O(d) parameters and units for a multi-layer network with O(log2 d) layers, and O(1) parameters with a recurrent neural network.

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting has emerged as a core component of intelligent transportation systems. However, timely accurate traffic forecasting, especially long-term forecasting, still remains an open challenge due to the highly nonlinear and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies of traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm of Spatial-Temporal Transformer Networks (STTNs) that leverages dynamical directed spatial dependencies and long-range temporal dependencies to improve the accuracy of long-term traffic forecasting. Specifically, we present a new variant of graph neural networks, named spatial transformer, by dynamically modeling directed spatial dependencies with self-attention mechanism to capture realtime traffic conditions as well as the directionality of traffic flows. Furthermore, different spatial dependency patterns can be jointly modeled with multi-heads attention mechanism to consider diverse relationships related to different factors (e.g. similarity, connectivity and covariance). On the other hand, the temporal transformer is utilized to model long-range bidirectional temporal dependencies across multiple time steps. Finally, they are composed as a block to jointly model the spatial-temporal dependencies for accurate traffic prediction. Compared to existing works, the proposed model enables fast and scalable training over a long range spatial-temporal dependencies. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-arts, especially forecasting long-term traffic flows on real-world PeMS-Bay and PeMSD7(M) datasets.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples.

	abstract = {This study proposes a deep generative adversarial architecture (GAA) for network-wide spatial-temporal traffic-state estimation. The GAA is able to combine traffic-flow theory with neural networks and thus improve the accuracy of traffic-state estimation. It consists of two Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM NNs) which capture correlation in time and space among traffic flow and traffic density. One of the LSTM NNs, called a discriminative network, aims to maximize the probability of assigning correct labels to both true traffic-state matrices (i.e., traffic flow and traffic density within a given spatial-temporal area) and the traffic-state matrices generated from the other neural network. The other LSTM NN, called a generative network, aims to generate traffic-state matrices which maximize the probability that the discriminative network assigns true labels to them. The two LSTM NNs are trained simultaneously such that the trained generative network can generate traffic matrices similar to those in the training data set. Given a traffic-state matrix with missing values, we use back-propagation on three defined loss functions to map the corrupted matrix to a latent space. The mapping vector is then passed through the pre-trained generative network to estimate the missing values of the corrupted matrix. The proposed GAA is compared with the existing Bayesian network approach on loop detector data collected from Seattle, Washington and that collected from San Diego, California. Experimental results indicate that the GAA can achieve higher accuracy in traffic-state estimation than the Bayesian network approach.},

Powered by advanced machine learning techniques, especially the deep learning method, prediction accuracy noticeably increases in recent years. However, most existing methods applied a data-driven paradigm and tend to ignore the outliers, which result in poor performance while handling burst phenomena in the traffic system. To overcome this problem, the prediction model needs to recognize different patterns and handle them in different ways. In this paper, we propose a new prediction model (called pattern sensitive network) that can handle different traffic patterns automatically. By using adversarial training, our model can make more accurate predictions in unusual states without compromising its performance in usual states. Experiments demonstrate that our method can work well in both usual traffic states and unusual traffic states.},

	abstract = {Traffic prediction is practically important to facilitate many real applications in urban areas such as relieving traffic congestion. Traditional traffic prediction models are mostly statistic based methods, and they cannot effectively capture the nonlinear, stochastic and time-varying characteristics of the urban transportation systems. Another limitation of these methods is that they usually focus on analyzing one or several roads or road segments, but are not capable to predict the traffic conditions of all the road segments in a large transportation network of a city as a whole. Therefore, in recent years, deep neural network based methods for forecasting the road network-scale traffic have been emphasized greatly. However, most existing deep neural network methods model the traffic data of a road network as "images" rather than graphs, and thus they suffer from the blurry prediction issue and do not perform well on the task of multi-step traffic prediction. In this paper, We propose a network-scale deep traffic prediction model called GCGAN by combining adversarial training and graph CNN. Specifically, we propose a Generative Adversarial Net based prediction framework to address the blurry prediction issue by introducing the adversarial training loss. To predict the traffic conditions in multiple future time intervals simultaneously, we design a sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) based encoder-decoder model as the generator of GCGAN. To fully capture the spatial correlations among the road segments of a transportation network, we propose to apply a graph convolution network (GCN) in both generator and discriminator of GCGAN for feature learning. We evaluate our proposal over a large real traffic dataset in the arterial road network of downtown Chicago. The results show that GCGAN significantly outperforms both traditional statistic based methods and recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

	abstract = {Spatial-temporal graph modeling is an important task to analyze the spatial relations and temporal trends of components in a system. Existing approaches mostly capture the spatial dependency on a fixed graph structure, assuming that the underlying relation between entities is pre-determined. However, the explicit graph structure (relation) does not necessarily reflect the true dependency and genuine relation may be missing due to the incomplete connections in the data. Furthermore, existing methods are ineffective to capture the temporal trends as the RNNs or CNNs employed in these methods cannot capture long-range temporal sequences. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper a novel graph neural network architecture, Graph WaveNet, for spatial-temporal graph modeling. By developing a novel adaptive dependency matrix and learn it through node embedding, our model can precisely capture the hidden spatial dependency in the data. With a stacked dilated 1D convolution component whose receptive field grows exponentially as the number of layers increases, Graph WaveNet is able to handle very long sequences. These two components are integrated seamlessly in a unified framework and the whole framework is learned in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on two public traffic network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm.},

As an essential part of ITS, traffic prediction can provide support in many aspects, such as road routing, traffic congestion control, etc. To provide a more comprehensive overview of the role of traffic forecasting in ITS systems, we will first introduce the corresponding ITS applications and discuss how traffic forecasting can improve the performance of these applications. Next, we will introduce the general prediction procedure as well as some basic concepts of traffic flow prediction, followed by a description of a general framework for implementing the traffic flow prediction. In this survey, mainly two sorts of prediction methods are focused, statistics-based and machine learning (ML)-based. These two types of approaches are more used in ITS traffic flow predictions these years, and service for different contexts. Generally speaking, the statistics-based models have better model interpretability, but the rigorous model structure limits the adaptability, while ML-based models are more flexible. Accordingly, we will introduce the characteristics of these two types of methods through specific examples of state-of-the-art approaches.

	abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have attracted an increasing amount of attention in recent years. Thanks to the fast development of vehicular computing hardware, vehicular sensors and citywide infrastructures, many impressive applications have been proposed under the topic of ITS, such as Vehicular Cloud (VC), intelligent traffic controls, etc. These applications can bring us a safer, more efficient, and also more enjoyable transportation environment. However, an accurate and efficient traffic flow prediction system is needed to achieve these applications, which creates an opportunity for applications under ITS to deal with the possible road situation in advance. To achieve better traffic flow prediction performance, many prediction methods have been proposed, such as mathematical modeling methods, parametric methods, and non-parametric methods. Among the non-parametric methods, the one of the most famous methods today is the Machine Learning-based (ML) method. It needs less prior knowledge about the relationship among different traffic patterns, less restriction on prediction tasks, and can better fit non-linear features in traffic data. There are several sub-classes under the ML method, such as regression model, kernel-based model, etc. For all these models, it is of vital importance that we choose an appropriate type of ML model before building up a prediction system. To do this, we should have a clear view of different ML methods; we investigate not only the accuracy of different models, but the applicable scenario and sometimes the specific type of problem the model was designed for. Therefore, in this paper, we are trying to build up a clear and thorough review of different ML models, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models. In order to do this, different ML models will be categorized based on the ML theory they use. In each category, we will first give a short introduction of the ML theory they use, and we will focus on the specific changes made to the model when applied to different prediction problems. Meanwhile, we will also compare among different categories, which will help us to have a macro overview of what types of ML methods are good at what types of prediction tasks according to their unique model features. Furthermore, we review the useful add-ons used in traffic prediction, and last but not least, we discuss the open challenges in the traffic prediction field.},

	abstract = {Road transportation is the largest and complex nonlinear entity of the traffic management system. Accurate prediction of traffic-related information is necessary for an effective functioning of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). It is still a challenge for the departments of transportation to choose an appropriate prediction technique for the ITS applications. That is, a user must be able to utilize the disseminated information effectively by the forecasting models. This paper provides a detailed survey of the latest forecasting technologies and contributes to understand the key concept behind the prediction approaches. To provide guidelines to the decision-maker, this paper reviews multifaceted techniques developed by various authors for traffic prediction. We start classifying each technique into four categories namely, Machine Learning (ML), Computational Intelligence (CI), Deep Learning (DL), and hybrid algorithms. Many have conducted survey using model-driven or data-driven methods. We are the first to explore the area of traffic prediction based on the advances in multifaceted techniques proposing algorithmic approaches for key traffic characteristics in the forecasting process. The role of dependent factors in the prediction are analyzed thoroughly. We have analyzed each algorithm chronologically based on various traffic traits. The approaches are summarized based on the rational usage and performance of each technique. The analysis led to several research queries, and the appropriate  responses are provided based on our detail survey. Finally, it is confirmed that currently, CI-MLs and DL hybrid techniques outperforms the rest in the field of traffic prediction. Ultimately suggested open challenges and future direction to explore the capability of DL and hybrid techniques further in the field of traffic prediction.},

The proliferation of digital mobility data, such as phone records, GPS traces, and social media posts, combined with the outstanding predictive power of artificial intelligence, triggered the application of deep learning to human mobility. In particular, the literature is focusing on three tasks: next-location prediction, i.e., predicting an individual’s future locations; crowd flow prediction, i.e., forecasting flows on a geographic region; and trajectory generation, i.e., generating realistic individual trajectories. Existing surveys focus on single tasks, data sources, mechanistic or traditional machine learning approaches, while a comprehensive description of deep learning solutions is missing. This survey provides: (i) basic notions on mobility and deep learning; (ii) a review of data sources and public datasets; (iii) a description of deep learning models and (iv) a discussion about relevant open challenges. Our survey is a guide to the leading deep learning solutions to next-location prediction, crowd flow prediction, and trajectory generation. At the same time, it helps deep learning scientists and practitioners understand the fundamental concepts and the open challenges of the study of human mobility.

This has also been the case of Intelligent Transportation Systems, in which several areas such as vehicular perception and traffic analysis have widely embraced Deep Learning as a core modeling technology. Particularly in short-term traffic forecasting, the capability of Deep Learning to deliver good results has generated a prevalent inertia towards using Deep Learning models, without examining in depth their benefits and downsides. This paper focuses on critically analyzing the state of the art in what refers to the use of Deep Learning for this particular Intelligent Transportation Systems research area. To this end, we elaborate on the findings distilled from a review of publications from recent years, based on two taxonomic criteria. A posterior critical analysis is held to formulate questions and trigger a necessary debate about the issues of Deep Learning for traffic forecasting. The study is completed with a benchmark of diverse short-term traffic forecasting methods over traffic datasets of different nature, aimed to cover a wide spectrum of possible scenarios. Our experimentation reveals that Deep Learning could not be the best modeling technique for every case, which unveils some caveats unconsidered to date that should be addressed by the community in prospective studies. These insights reveal new challenges and research opportunities in road traffic forecasting, which are enumerated and discussed thoroughly, with the intention of inspiring and guiding future research efforts in this field.},

Accurate identification of the spatiotemporal structure (dependencies amongst traffic flows in space and time) plays a critical role in modern traffic forecasting methodologies, and recent developments of data-driven feature selection and extraction methods allow the identification of complex relationships. This paper systematically reviews studies that apply feature selection and extraction methods for spatiotemporal traffic forecasting.

A synthesis of bibliographic sources clarifies the advantages and disadvantages of different feature selection and extraction methods for learning the spatiotemporal structure and discovers trends in their applications.

This survey aims to provide a systematic review of machine learning for STSF. In this survey, we define the STSF problem and classify it into three subcategories: Trajectory Forecasting of Moving Point Cloud (TF-MPC), STSF on Regular Grid (STSF-RG) and STSF on Irregular Grid (STSF-IG). We then introduce the two major challenges of STSF: 1) how to learn a model for multi-step forecasting and 2) how to adequately model the spatial and temporal structures. After that, we review the existing works for solving these challenges, including the general learning strategies for multi-step forecasting, the classical machine learning based methods for STSF, and the deep learning based methods for STSF.

	abstract = {Deep learning methods are being increasingly applied in transport studies, while the methods require modellers to go through a try-and-error model tuning process particularly on choosing neural network structure. Moreover, the accuracy level also depends on other factors such as the type of data, sample size, region of data collection, and time of prediction. To efficiently facilitate such a model tuning process, this study attempts to summarize the relationship between the prediction accuracy of deep learning models and the factors which influence it. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature by adopting a detailed search strategy, followed by a meta-analysis on prediction accuracy. Four separate linear mixed effects models, taking into account unobserved heterogeneities in prediction accuracy across studies, were developed to statistically test the impacts of influential factors on prediction accuracy for (a) all observations (136 studies; 2314 cases), (b) studies with MAPE, MRE, and average accuracy indicators (86 studies; 1,878 cases), (c) classification-based studies with accuracy indicator (29 studies; 220 cases), and (d) traffic forecasting studies with MAPE, MRE, and average accuracy indicators (36 studies, 991 cases). The final model includes additional factors to test the influence of sample size and time horizon of prediction variables. The findings showed that, as expected, deep learning models, particularly ones that consider spatiotemporal dependencies of transport phenomena, show better prediction accuracies compared to conventional machine learning models. We also found that, on average, the prediction accuracy is improved by 5.90\% with 100 million additional data, while the accuracy is reduced by 5.28\% with 100 min increase in time horizon of prediction in traffic forecasting studies.

	abstract = {In recent years, various deep learning architectures have been proposed to solve complex challenges (e.g. spatial dependency, temporal dependency) in traffic domain, which have achieved satisfactory performance. These architectures are composed of multiple deep learning techniques in order to tackle various challenges in traffic tasks. Traditionally, convolution neural networks (CNNs) are utilized to model spatial dependency by decomposing the traffic network as grids. However, many traffic networks are graph-structured in nature. In order to utilize such spatial information fully, it’s more appropriate to formulate traffic networks as graphs mathematically. Recently, various novel deep learning techniques have been developed to process graph data, called graph neural networks (GNNs). More and more works combine GNNs with other deep learning techniques to construct an architecture dealing with various challenges in a complex traffic task, where GNNs are responsible for extracting spatial correlations in traffic network. These graph-based architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance. To provide a comprehensive and clear picture of such emerging trend, this survey carefully examines various graph-based deep learning architectures in many traffic applications. We first give guidelines to formulate a traffic problem based on graph and construct graphs from various kinds of traffic datasets. Then we decompose these graph-based architectures to discuss their shared deep learning techniques, clarifying the utilization of each technique in traffic tasks. What’s more, we summarize some common traffic challenges and the corresponding graph-based deep learning solutions to each challenge.

	abstract = {With the emerging concepts of smart cities and intelligent transportation systems, accurate traffic sensing and prediction have become critically important to support urban management and traffic control. In recent years, the rapid uptake of the Internet of Vehicles and the rising pervasiveness of mobile services have produced unprecedented amounts of data to serve traffic sensing and prediction applications. However, it is significantly challenging to fulfill the computation demands by the big traffic data with ever-increasing complexity and diversity. Deep learning, with its powerful capabilities in representation learning and multi-level abstractions, has recently become the most effective approach in many intelligent sensing systems. In this paper, we present an up-to-date literature review on the most advanced research works in deep learning for intelligent traffic sensing and prediction.},

	abstract = {Urban vehicle emission prediction can help the regulation of vehicle pollution and traffic control. However, it is hard to predict the spatiotemporal variation of vehicle emission because of the spatial interactions and temporal correlations between different road segments as well as the high nonlinearity and complexity of vehicle emission variation. The existing methods solve the problem by splitting the region into standard segments or grids based on conventional deep learning methods, without considering that urban vehicle emission varies by graph-structured traffic road network and depends on many complex external environment factors. To address these issues, a spatiotemporal graph convolution multifusion network (ST-MFGCN) is proposed to leverage the graph structural properties as the inherent connectivity of road network for urban vehicle emission prediction, which can capture the vehicle emission spatiotemporal variation patterns and learn the effects of complex environmental factors. The proposed model consists of three parts: 1) a spatiotemporal graph convolution module to capture spatiotemporal dependencies by merging closeness, period, and trend sequences with temporal convolution as well as graph convolution is introduced to model the spatial dependencies; 2) an external factor component to divide multisource external factors into global and individual external features; and 3) a general fusion component to merge the spatiotemporal patterns and the external features as well as fit the mutation of emission measurement data by multifusion strategy. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on the practical monitoring data of vehicle emission data in Hefei, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model can predict regional vehicle emissions effectively.},

Complex nonlinear interactions between various spatio-temporal variables govern the propagation of these delays which can quickly spread throughout railway networks, causing further severe disruptions. To better understand the effects of these nonlinear interactions, we present a novel, graph-based formulation of a subset of the British railway network. Using this graph-based formulation, we apply the Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) model to predict cascading delays throughout the railway network. We find that this model outperforms other statistical models which do not explicitly account for interactions on the rail network, thus showing the value of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach in predicting delays for the British railway system.},

In this paper, we apply deep neural networks to the nonlinear spatiotemporal physics problem of vehicle traffic dynamics. We consider problems of estimating macroscopic quantities (e.g., the queue at an intersection) at a lane level. First-principles modeling at the lane scale has been a challenge due to complexities in modeling social behaviors like lane changes, and those behaviors' resultant macro-scale effects. Following domain knowledge that upstream/downstream lanes and neighboring lanes affect each others' traffic flows in distinct ways, we apply a form of neural attention that allows the neural network layers to aggregate information from different lanes in different manners. Using a microscopic traffic simulator as a testbed, we obtain results showing that an attentional neural network model can use information from nearby lanes to improve predictions, and, that explicitly encoding the lane-to-lane relationship types significantly improves performance. We also demonstrate the transfer of our learned neural network to a more complex road network, discuss how its performance degradation may be attributable to new traffic behaviors induced by increased topological complexity, and motivate learning dynamics models from many road network topologies.},

Recently, substantial research efforts have been devoted to applying deep learning methods to graphs, resulting in beneficial advances in graph analysis techniques. In this survey, we comprehensively review the different types of deep learning methods on graphs. We divide the existing methods into five categories based on their model architectures and training strategies: graph recurrent neural networks, graph convolutional networks, graph autoencoders, graph reinforcement learning, and graph adversarial methods. We then provide a comprehensive overview of these methods in a systematic manner mainly by following their development history. We also analyze the differences and compositions of different methods.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile-internet technologies, on-demand ride-sourcing services have become increasingly popular and largely reshaped the way people travel. Demand prediction is one of the most fundamental components in supply-demand management systems of ride-sourcing platforms. With an accurate short-term prediction for origin-destination (OD) demand, the platforms make precise and timely decisions on real-time matching, idle vehicle reallocations, and ride-sharing vehicle routing, etc. Compared to the zone-based demand prediction that has been examined in many previous studies, OD-based demand prediction is more challenging. This is mainly due to the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among the demand of different OD pairs. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder Residual Multi-Graph Convolutional network (ST-ED-RMGC), a novel deep learning model for predicting ride-sourcing demand of various OD pairs. Firstly, the model constructs OD graphs, which utilize adjacent matrices to characterize the non-Euclidean pair-wise geographical and semantic correlations among different OD pairs. Secondly, based on the constructed graphs, a residual multi-graph convolutional (RMGC) network is designed to encode the contextual-aware spatial dependencies, and a long-short term memory (LSTM) network is used to encode the temporal dependencies, into a dense vector space. Finally, we reuse the RMGC networks to decode the compressed vector back to OD graphs and predict the future OD demand. Through extensive experiments on the for-hire-vehicles datasets in Manhattan, New York City, we show that our proposed deep learning framework outperforms the state-of-arts by a significant margin.},

This task is challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal correlations (e.g., the constraints of road network and the law of dynamic change with time). Existing work tried to solve this problem by exploiting a variety of spatiotemporal models. However, we observe that more semantic pair-wise correlations among possibly distant roads are also critical for traffic flow prediction. To jointly model the spatial, temporal, semantic correlations with various global features in the road network, this paper proposes T-MGCN (Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning framework for traffic flow prediction. First, we identify several kinds of semantic correlations, and encode the non-Euclidean spatial correlations and heterogeneous semantic correlations among roads into multiple graphs. These correlations are then modeled by a multi-graph convolutional network. Second, a recurrent neural network is utilized to learn dynamic patterns of traffic flow to capture the temporal correlations. Third, a fully connected neural network is utilized to fuse the spatiotemporal correlations with global features. We evaluate T-MGCN on two real-world traffic datasets and observe improvement by approximately 3\% to 6\% as compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.},

For a more accurate prediction, recent studies started using not only the temporal speed patterns but also the spatial information on the road network through the graph convolutional networks. Even though the road network is highly complex due to its non-Euclidean and directional characteristics, previous approaches mainly focused on modeling the spatial dependencies using the distance only. In this paper, we identify two essential spatial dependencies in traffic forecasting in addition to distance, direction and positional relationship, for designing basic graph elements as the fundamental building blocks. Using the building blocks, we suggest DDP-GCN (Distance, Direction, and Positional relationship Graph Convolutional Network) to incorporate the three spatial relationships into deep neural networks. We evaluate the proposed model with two large-scale real-world datasets, and find positive improvements for long-term forecasting in highly complex urban networks.

	abstract = {Deep Learning's recent successes have mostly relied on Convolutional Networks, which exploit fundamental statistical properties of images, sounds and video data: the local stationarity and multi-scale compositional structure, that allows expressing long range interactions in terms of shorter, localized interactions. However, there exist other important examples, such as text documents or bioinformatic data, that may lack some or all of these strong statistical regularities. In this paper we consider the general question of how to construct deep architectures with small learning complexity on general non-Euclidean domains, which are typically unknown and need to be estimated from the data. In particular, we develop an extension of Spectral Networks which incorporates a Graph Estimation procedure, that we test on large-scale classification problems, matching or improving over Dropout Networks with far less parameters to estimate.},

At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework.

However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings.  Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

Recently, several hybrid deep learning models have been developed to capture such dependencies. These approaches typically utilize convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks (GNNs) to model spatial dependency and leverage recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn temporal dependency. However, RNNs are only able to capture sequential information in the time series, while being incapable of modeling their periodicity (e.g., weekly patterns). Moreover, RNNs are difficult to parallelize, making training and prediction less efficient. In this work we propose a novel deep learning architecture called Traffic Transformer to capture the continuity and periodicity of time series and to model spatial dependency. Our work takes inspiration from Google’s Transformer framework for machine translation. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world traffic data sets, and the results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models by a substantial margin.},

	abstract = {Urban ride-hailing demand prediction is a crucial but challenging task for intelligent transportation system construction. Predictable ride-hailing demand can facilitate more reasonable vehicle scheduling and online car-hailing platform dispatch. Conventional deep learning methods with no external structured data can be accomplished via hybrid models of CNNs and RNNs by meshing plentiful pixel-level labeled data, but spatial data sparsity and limited learning capabilities on temporal long-term dependencies are still two striking bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we propose a new virtual graph modeling method to focus on significant demand regions and a novel Deep Multi-View Spatiotemporal Virtual Graph Neural Network (DMVST-VGNN) to strengthen learning capabilities of spatial dynamics and temporal long-term dependencies. Specifically, DMVST-VGNN integrates the structures of 1D Convolutional Neural Network, Multi Graph Attention Neural Network and Transformer layer, which correspond to short-term temporal dynamics view, spatial dynamics view and long-term temporal dynamics view respectively. In this paper, experiments are conducted on two large-scale New York City datasets in fine-grained prediction scenes. And the experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of DMVST-VGNN framework in significant citywide ride-hailing demand prediction.},

	abstract = {Traffic prediction, which aims at predicting future traffic conditions based on historical observations, is of considerable significance in urban management. However, such tasks are challenging due to the high complexity of traffic flow. Traditional statistical learning methods perform badly in handling such regularities. Furthermore, these methods often split spatial information and temporal information as individual features, which cause extracted features hard to be fused. In this paper, we target on efficiently capturing such highly nonlinear dependencies and fusing features from both spatial and temporal dimensions to predict future traffic flow conditions accurately. To tackle this problem, we proposed the Self-Attention based Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (SAST-GNN). In SAST-GNN, we innovatively proposed to add a self-attention mechanism to more accurately extract features from the temporal dimension and the spatial dimension simultaneously. At the same time, for better fusing information from both dimensions, we improved the spatio-temporal architecture by adding channels(or heads) and residual blocks. Thus features can be fused from different aspects. Experiments on two real-world datasets illustrated that our model outperforms six baselines in traffic flow prediction tasks. Especially in short-term and mid-term prediction based on long-term dependencies, our model performs much better than other baselines.},

Graph networks extract invariant features to permutations of adjacent regions instead of convolutional layers. Temporal-guided embedding explicitly learns temporal contexts from training data and is substituted for the input of long-term histories from days/weeks ago. TGNet learns an autoregressive model, conditioned on temporal contexts of forecasting targets from temporal-guided embedding. Finally, our model achieves competitive performances with other baselines on three spatiotemporal demand dataset from real-world, but the number of trainable parameters is about 20 times smaller than a state-of-the-art baseline.

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting is a classical task for traffic management and it plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. However, since traffic data are mostly collected by traffic sensors or probe vehicles, sensor failures and the lack of probe vehicles will inevitably result in missing values in the collected raw data for some specific links in the traffic network. Although missing values can be imputed, existing data imputation methods normally need long-term historical traffic state data. As for short-term traffic forecasting, especially under edge computing and online prediction scenarios, traffic forecasting models with the capability of handling missing values are needed. In this study, we consider the traffic network as a graph and define the transition between network-wide traffic states at consecutive time steps as a graph Markov process. In this way, missing traffic states can be inferred step by step and the spatial–temporal relationships among the roadway links can be incorporated. Based on the graph Markov process, we propose a new neural network architecture for spatial–temporal data forecasting, i.e. the graph Markov network (GMN). By incorporating the spectral graph convolution operation, we also propose a spectral graph Markov network (SGMN). The proposed models are compared with baseline models and tested on three real-world traffic state datasets with various missing rates. Experimental results show that the proposed GMN and SGMN can achieve superior prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Besides, the proposed models’ parameters, weights, and predicted results are comprehensively analyzed and visualized.},

	abstract = {Modern intelligent transportation systems provide data that allow real-time dynamic demand prediction, which is essential for planning and operations. The main challenge of prediction of dynamic origin–destination (O-D) demand matrices is that demand cannot be directly measured by traffic sensors; instead, it has to be inferred from aggregate traffic flow data on traffic links. Specifically, spatial correlation, congestion and time dependent factors need to be considered in general transportation networks. This paper proposes a novel O-D prediction framework combining heterogeneous prediction in graph neural networks and Kalman filter to recognize spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously. The underlying road network topology is converted into a corresponding line graph in the newly designed fusion line graph convolutional networks (FL-GCNs), which provide a general framework of predicting spatial-temporal O-D flows from link information. Data from the New Jersey Turnpike network are used to evaluate the proposed model. The results show that the proposed approach yields the best performance under various prediction scenarios. In addition, the advantage of combining deep neural networks and Kalman filter is demonstrated.},

However, it is very challenging since the traffic flows usually show high nonlinearities and complex patterns. Most existing traffic flow prediction methods, lacking abilities of modeling the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations of traffic data, thus cannot yield satisfactory prediction results. In this paper, we propose a novel attention based spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN) model to solve traffic flow forecasting problem. ASTGCN mainly consists of three independent components to respectively model three temporal properties of traffic flows, i.e., recent, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic dependencies. More specifically, each component contains two major parts: 1) the spatial-temporal attention mechanism to effectively capture the dynamic spatialtemporal correlations in traffic data; 2) the spatial-temporal convolution which simultaneously employs graph convolutions to capture the spatial patterns and common standard convolutions to describe the temporal features. The output of the three components are weighted fused to generate the final prediction results. Experiments on two real-world datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) demonstrate that the proposed ASTGCN model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Traffic prediction is of great importance to traffic management and public safety, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as spatial dependency of complicated road networks and temporal dynamics, and many more. The factors make traffic prediction a challenging task due to the uncertainty and complexity of traffic states. In the literature, many research works have applied deep learning methods on traffic prediction problems combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which CNNs are utilized for spatial dependency and RNNs for temporal dynamics. However, such combinations cannot capture the connectivity and globality of traffic networks. In this paper, we first propose to adopt residual recurrent graph neural networks (Res-RGNN) that can capture graph-based spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics jointly. Due to gradient vanishing, RNNs are hard to capture periodic temporal correlations. Hence, we further propose a novel hop scheme into Res-RGNN to utilize the periodic temporal dependencies. Based on Res-RGNN and hop Res-RGNN, we finally propose a novel end-to-end multiple Res-RGNNs framework, referred to as “MRes-RGNN”, for traffic prediction. Experimental results on two traffic datasets have demonstrated that the proposed MRes-RGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.},

	abstract = {Traffic prediction is a core problem in the intelligent transportation system and has broad applications in the transportation management and planning, and the main challenge of this field is how to efficiently explore the spatial and temporal information of traffic data. Recently, various deep learning methods, such as convolution neural network (CNN), have shown promising performance in traffic prediction. However, it samples traffic data in regular grids as the input of CNN, thus it destroys the spatial structure of the road network. In this paper, we introduce a graph network and propose an optimized graph convolution recurrent neural network for traffic prediction, in which the spatial information of the road network is represented as a graph. Additionally, distinguishing with most current methods using a simple and empirical spatial graph, the proposed method learns an optimized graph through a data-driven way in the training phase, which reveals the latent relationship among the road segments from the traffic data. Lastly, the proposed method is evaluated on three real-world case studies, and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art traffic prediction methods.},

	abstract = {Due to the widespread applications in real-world scenarios, metro ridership prediction is a crucial but challenging task in intelligent transportation systems. However, conventional methods either ignore the topological information of metro systems or directly learn on physical topology, and cannot fully explore the patterns of ridership evolution. To address this problem, we model a metro system as graphs with various topologies and propose a unified Physical-Virtual Collaboration Graph Network (PVCGN), which can effectively learn the complex ridership patterns from the tailor-designed graphs. Specifically, a physical graph is directly built based on the realistic topology of the studied metro system, while a similarity graph and a correlation graph are built with virtual topologies under the guidance of the inter-station passenger flow similarity and correlation. These complementary graphs are incorporated into a Graph Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (GC-GRU) for spatial-temporal representation learning. Further, a Fully-Connected Gated Recurrent Unit (FC-GRU) is also applied to capture the global evolution tendency. Finally, we develop a Seq2Seq model with GC-GRU and FC-GRU to forecast the future metro ridership sequentially. Extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks (e.g., Shanghai Metro and Hangzhou Metro) well demonstrate the superiority of our PVCGN for station-level metro ridership prediction. Moreover, we apply the proposed PVCGN to address the online origin-destination (OD) ridership prediction and the experiment results show the universality of our method. Our code and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/HCPLab-SYSU/PVCGN.},

Many application domains involve highly dynamic graphs where temporal information is crucial, e.g. traffic networks and financial transaction graphs. Despite the constant progress made on learning structured data, there is still a lack of effective means to extract dynamic complex features from spatio-temporal structures. Particularly, conventional models such as convolutional networks or recurrent neural networks are incapable of revealing the temporal patterns in short or long terms and exploring the spatial properties in local or global scope from spatio-temporal graphs simultaneously. To tackle this problem, we design a novel multi-scale architecture, Spatio-Temporal U-Net (ST-UNet), for graph-structured time series modeling. In this U-shaped network, a paired sampling operation is proposed in spacetime domain accordingly: the pooling (ST-Pool) coarsens the input graph in spatial from its deterministic partition while abstracts multi-resolution temporal dependencies through dilated recurrent skip connections; based on previous settings in the downsampling, the unpooling (ST-Unpool) restores the original structure of spatio-temporal graphs and resumes regular intervals within graph sequences. Experiments on spatio-temporal prediction tasks demonstrate that our model effectively captures comprehensive features in multiple scales and achieves substantial improvements over mainstream methods on several real-world datasets.},

	abstract = {Thanks to recent progresses in mobile payment, IoT, electric motors, batteries and location-based services, Dockless E-scooter Sharing (DES) has become a popular means of last-mile commute for a growing number of (smart) cities. As e-scooters are getting deployed dynamically and flexibly across city regions that expand and/or shrink, with subsequent social, commercial and environmental evaluation, accurate prediction of the distribution of e-scooters given reconfigured regions becomes essential for the city planners and service providers. To meet this need, we propose GCScoot, a novel dynamic flow distribution prediction for reconfiguring urban DES systems. Based on the real-world datasets with reconfiguration, we analyze the mobility features of the e-scooter distribution and flow dynamics for the data-driven designs. To adapt to dynamic reconfiguration of DES deployment, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph capsule neural network within GCScoot to predict the future dockless e-scooter flows given the reconfigured regions. GCScoot preprocesses the historical spatial e-scooter distributions into flow graph structures, where discretized city regions are considered as nodes and their mutual flows as edges. Given data-driven designs regarding distance, ride flows and region connectivity, the dynamic region-to-region correlations embedded within the temporal flow graphs are captured through the graph capsule neural network which accurately predicts the DES flows. We have conducted extensive empirical studies upon three different e-scooter datasets (\&gt;2.8 million rides in total) in populous US cities including Austin TX, Louisville KY and Minneapolis MN. The evaluation results have corroborated the accuracy and effectiveness of GCScoot in predicting dynamic distribution of dockless e-scooters’ mobility.},

	abstract = {Forecasting traffic accidents at a fine-grained spatial scale is essential to provide effective precautions and improve traffic safety in smart urban sensing applications. Current solutions primarily rely on complete historical traffic accident records and/or accurate real-time traffic sensor data for traffic risk prediction. These solutions are prone to various limitations (e.g., facility availability, privacy and legal constraints). In this paper, we address those limitations by exploring two types of widely available and complementary data sources: social media sensing and remote sensing. However, three important technical challenges exist: i) the social media data and remote sensing data often have different data modalities and characteristics, which makes it difficult to effectively fuse them for traffic risk forecasting; ii) the social media data is often noisy, providing fuzzy evidence to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic accident occurrences; iii) the remote sensing data often contains complex visual features, making it a non-trivial task to explore the accident occurrence correlation between different locations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphCast, a multi-modal graph neural network framework to accurately forecast the traffic risks in a city by jointly exploring the social media sensing and remote sensing paradigms. The evaluation results on a real-world case study in New York City show that our GraphCast scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art conventional and deep learning baselines in accurately forecasting the traffic risks in a city.},

Previous works on accident forecasting are often performed on hour levels, utilizing existed neural networks with static region-wise correlations taken into account. However, it is still challenging when the granularity of forecasting step improves as the highly dynamic nature of road network and inherent rareness of accident records in one training sample, which leads to biased results and zero-inflated issue. In this work, we propose a novel framework RiskOracle, to improve the prediction granularity to minute levels. Specifically, we first transform the zero-risk values in labels to fit the training network. Then, we propose the Differential Time-varying Graph neural network (DTGN) to capture the immediate changes of traffic status and dynamic inter-subregion correlations. Furthermore, we adopt multi-task and region selection schemes to highlight citywide most-likely accident subregions, bridging the gap between biased risk values and sporadic accident distribution.

An accurate urban accident forecasting enables higher-quality police force pre-allocation and safe route planning for both traffic administrations and travelers, maximumly reducing injuries and damages. Off-the-shelf short-term accident forecasting methods, which focus on modeling static region-wise correlations with existing neural networks, mostly performed on hour levels and with single step. However, given the dynamic nature of road networks and expanding urban areas, it is challenging when the spatiotemporal granularity of forecasting improves as the rareness of accident records and complexity of long-term future dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework RiskSeq, to foresee sparse urban accidents with finer granularities and multiple steps in spatiotemporal perspective. In particular, we design region-wise proximity measurements and temporal feature differential operations, and embed them into a novel Differential Time-varying Graph Convolution Network to dynamically capture traffic variations. Considering the hierarchical spatial dependencies and obvious context influences, a hierarchical sequence learning structure is devised by introducing contextual factors into a step-wise decoder. The multi-scale spatial risks are learned jointly to boost the risk predictions based on risk-gather and risk-assign networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate our RiskSeq can increase 5 to 15 percent performances on two datasets.},

This article presents a novel and effective approach for achieving the task based on a machine-learning technique and publicly available street-view imagery and point-of-interest (POI) data. The proposed multiple-graph-based convolutional network architecture can: (a) extract essential urban built environment features from street-view imagery and neighboring POIs; (b) model the spatial dependencies between traffic congestion on road networks via graph convolution; and (c) evaluate the risk level of road intersections to emerging congestion situations based on local built environment features. We apply the model to Wuhan in China, and predict the potential congestion spots across the city. The results confirm that the model prediction is highly consistent (about 85.5\%) when compared to the ground-truth data based on traffic indices derived from a big taxi GPS trajectory dataset. This research enhances the understanding of traffic congestion situations under various geographic, societal, and economic contexts based on easily accessible road, street-view, and POI datasets at large spatiotemporal scales.},

Conventionally, machine-learning-based traffic prediction is frequently carried out. Model learning requires large amounts of training data; however, collecting sufficient samples is a challenge in the event of traffic incidents. To address this challenge, large amounts of traffic data were generated by performing traffic simulations under various traffic incidents. These data were used as training data, and a deep learning model with graph convolution and input of traffic incident information features was proposed. Subsequently, the prediction accuracy was compared with other models such as long short-term memory, which is typically used in traffic prediction.

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting is imperative to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and it has always been considered as a challenging research topic, due to the complex topological structure of the urban road network and the temporal stochastic nature of dynamic change. Popular sports events attract vast numbers of spectators travelling to the event, which will have a substantial effect on ITS, showing peaks on the network that can collapse a smart city's ITS. In this paper, we tackle traffic forecasting and use the Doha network in Qatar and the FIFA World Cup 2022 (FWC 2022) event as a case study. We propose a novel technique for embedding road network graphs into a Temporal-Graph Convolutional Network. The embedding process includes a modification to the graph weights based on graph theory and the properties of the line graph. Extensive simulations are carried out on a real-world calibrated dataset from Doha's road network. Our Temporal Line Graph Convolutional Network (TLGCN) proposal shows outstanding performance when compared to state-of-the-art techniques, not only for huge special events but also for the regular daily traffic.},

	abstract = {GPS-equipped taxis can be regarded as mobile sensors probing traffic flows on road surfaces, and taxi drivers are usually experienced in finding the fastest (quickest) route to a destination based on their knowledge. In this paper, we mine smart driving directions from the historical GPS trajectories of a large number of taxis, and provide a user with the practically fastest route to a given destination at a given departure time. In our approach, we propose a time-dependent landmark graph, where a node (landmark) is a road segment frequently traversed by taxis, to model the intelligence of taxi drivers and the properties of dynamic road networks. Then, a Variance-Entropy-Based Clustering approach is devised to estimate the distribution of travel time between two landmarks in different time slots. Based on this graph, we design a two-stage routing algorithm to compute the practically fastest route. We build our system based on a real-world trajectory dataset generated by over 33,000 taxis in a period of 3 months, and evaluate the system by conducting both synthetic experiments and in-the-field evaluations. As a result, 60-70\% of the routes suggested by our method are faster than the competing methods, and 20\% of the routes share the same results. On average, 50\% of our routes are at least 20\% faster than the competing approaches.},

In this work, a new topological framework, called Linkage Network, is proposed to model the road networks and present the propagation patterns of traffic flow. Based on the Linkage Network model, a novel online predictor, named Graph Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN), is designed to learn the propagation patterns in the graph. It could simultaneously predict traffic flow for all road segments based on the information gathered from the whole graph, which thus reduces the computational complexity significantly from O(nm) to O(n+m), while keeping the high accuracy. Moreover, it can also predict the variations of traffic trends. Experiments based on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing prediction methods.},

	abstract = {Traffic prediction is a challenging task due to the time-varying nature of traffic patterns and the complex spatial dependency of road networks. Adding to the challenge, there are a number of errors introduced in traffic sensor reporting, including bias and noise. However, most of the previous works treat the sensor observations as exact measures ignoring the effect of unknown noise. To model the spatial and temporal dependencies, existing studies combine graph neural networks (GNNs) with other deep learning techniques but their equal weighting of different dependencies limits the models' ability to capture the real dynamics in the traffic network. To deal with the above issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Deep Kalman Filtering Network (DKFN) to forecast the network-wide traffic state by modeling the self and neighbor dependencies as two streams, and their predictions are fused under the statistical theory and optimized through the Kalman filtering network. First, the reliability of each stream is evaluated using variances. Then, the Kalman filter is leveraged to properly fuse noisy observations in terms of their reliability. Experimental results reflect the superiority of the proposed method over baseline models on two real-world traffic datasets in the speed prediction task.},

	abstract = {Stationarity is a key assumption in many statistical models for random processes. With recent developments in the field of graph signal processing, the conventional notion of wide-sense stationarity has been extended to random processes defined on the vertices of graphs. It has been shown that well-known spectral graph kernel methods assume that the underlying random process over a graph is stationary. While many approaches have been proposed, both in machine learning and signal processing literature, to model stationary random processes over graphs, they are too restrictive to characterize real-world datasets as most of them are non-stationary processes. In this paper, to well-characterize a non-stationary process over graph, we propose a novel model and a computationally efficient algorithm that partitions a large graph into disjoint clusters such that the process is stationary on each of the clusters but independent across clusters. We evaluate our model for traffic prediction on a large-scale dataset of fine-grained highway travel times in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The accuracy of our method is very close to the state-of-the-art graph based deep learning methods while the computational complexity of our model is substantially smaller.},

Timely and accurate traffic prediction is necessary to provide valuable information for different urban planning, traffic control, and guidance tasks.

The development of mathematical models, and, in particular, the deep learning models, allows to use convolutional neural networks to solve traffic prediction problems. In this article, we analyze the architecture of the graph convolution network for traffic flow prediction.

Data imputation provides great support for the acquisition of complete flow data, which enables us to better understand regional connections and mobility patterns. However, existing models or approaches neglect the network structure of spatial flows, thus resulting in inappropriate estimates and a low performance. The development of graph neural networks offers a powerful tool to deal with graph-structured data. In this article, we proposed a spatial interaction graph convolutional network model, which combines graph convolution and a mapping function to predict flow data from the perspective of network learning. This model utilizes geographical unit embedding in local spatial networks to improve prediction accuracy. A negative sampling technique is adopted to reduce misestimation. Experiments on Beijing taxi trip data verified the usefulness of our model in spatial flow prediction. We also demonstrated that a biased training sample had a negative impact on the model’s performance. More attributes of geographical units, a more proper negative sampling rate and a larger training set can increase the prediction accuracy of flow data.},

	abstract = {Deep learning-based techniques are the state of the art in road traffic prediction or forecasting. Several deep neural networks have been proposed to predict the traffic but they have not been evaluated under common datasets. Current studies analyze their capacity to predict road traffic in general but do not focus on their capacity to predict the formation of congestions. This is critical for avoiding congestions or mitigate their negative impact. This paper progresses the current state of the art by presenting a comprehensive comparison of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks for road traffic prediction. The comparison is conducted using the same real traffic datasets, and under normal and congested traffic conditions. The evaluation includes new deep neural networks and error recurrent models. Our study first demonstrates that accurately predicting the traffic overall does not imply that a deep neural network can accurately predict the traffic when congestions are being formed. This reinforces the idea that prediction techniques must also be evaluated under congestion conditions. Our analysis also shows that exploiting the spatiotemporal evolution of the traffic (and not just the temporal one) provides better prediction accuracy overall and in particular under congestion conditions. The study also demonstrates that error recurrent models outperform deep neural networks that do not utilize an error feedback both under normal and congested traffic conditions. In particular, our study shows that the error recurrent model eRCNN is the deep learning technique that achieves to date the best traffic prediction accuracy. It is also important emphasizing that error recurrent models achieve better prediction accuracy with shallower neural networks and therefore lower computational cost.},

	abstract = {Accurate demand forecasting of different public transport modes (e.g., buses and light rails) is essential for public service operation. However, the development level of various modes often varies significantly, which makes it hard to predict the demand of the modes with insufficient knowledge and sparse station distribution (i.e., station-sparse mode). Intuitively, different public transit modes may exhibit shared demand patterns temporally and spatially in a city. As such, we propose to enhance the demand prediction of station-sparse modes with the data from station-intensive mode and design a Memory-Augmented Multi-task Re current Network (MATURE) to derive the transferable demand patterns from each mode and boost the prediction of station-sparse modes through adapting the relevant patterns from the station-intensive mode. Specifically, MATURE comprises three components: 1) a memory-augmented recurrent network for strengthening the ability to capture the long-short term information and storing temporal knowledge of each transit mode; 2) a knowledge adaption module to adapt the relevant knowledge from a station-intensive source to station-sparse sources; 3) a multi-task learning framework to incorporate all the information and forecast the demand of multiple modes jointly. The experimental results on a real-world dataset covering four public transport modes demonstrate that our model can promote the demand forecasting performance for the station-sparse modes.},

First, an undirected graph model was formed by considering the spatial pattern distribution of taxi trips on road networks. Then, LSTMs were used to extract the temporal features of traffic flows. Finally, the model was trained using a multitask learning strategy to improve the model’s generalizability. In the experiments, the efficiency and accuracy were verified with real-world taxi trajectory data.

However, there still exist two main limitations: (1) They do not effectively model dynamic traffic patterns in irregular regions; (2) The traffic flow of a region is strongly correlated to the transition-flow between different regions, while this issue is largely ignored by existing approaches. To address these issues, we propose a multitask deep learning model called MTGCN for a more accurate traffic flow prediction. First, to process the input traffic network data, we propose using graph convolution in place of traditional grid-based convolution to model spatial dependencies between irregular regions. Second, as original graph convolution can not well respond to traffic dynamics, we design a novel attention mechanism to capture dynamic traffic patterns. At last, to obtain a more accurate prediction result, we integrate two correlated tasks which respectively predict two types of traffic flows (region-flow and transition-flow) as a whole, by combining the representations learned from each task in a rational way. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and the results show that our proposed method achieves better performance compared with other baseline models.},

	abstract = {Crowd flow prediction, which aims to predict the in-out flows (e.g. the traffic of crowds, taxis and bikes ) of different areas of a city, is critically important to many real applications including public safety and intelligent transportation systems. The challenges of this problem lie in both the dynamic mobility patterns of crowds and the complex spatial-temporal correlations. Meanwhile, crowd flow is highly correlated to and affected by the Origin-Destination (OD) locations of the flow trajectories, which is largely ignored by existing works. In this paper, we study the novel problem of predicting the crowd flow and flow OD simultaneously, and propose a multi-task adversarial spatial-temporal network model entitled MT-ASTN to effectively address it. As a multi-task learning model, MT-ASTN adopts a shared-private framework which contains private spatial-temporal encoders, a shared spatial-temporal encoder, and decoders to learn the task-specific features and shared features. To effectively extract high quality shared features, a discriminative loss on task classification and an adversarial loss on shared feature extraction are incorporated to reduce information redundancy. We also design an attentive temporal queue to automatically capture the complex temporal dependency without the help of domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations are conducted over the bike and taxicab trip datasets in New York. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both tasks.},

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting approaches are critical to developing adaptive strategies for mobility. Traffic patterns have complex spatial and temporal dependencies that make accurate forecasting on large highway networks a challenging task. Recently, diffusion convolutional recurrent neural networks (DCRNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in traffic forecasting by capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the traffic. Despite the promising results, however, applying DCRNNs for large highway networks still remains elusive because of computational and memory bottlenecks. This paper presents an approach for implementing a DCRNN for a large highway network that overcomes these limitations. This approach uses a graph-partitioning method to decompose a large highway network into smaller networks and trains them independently. The efficacy of the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN approach to model the traffic on a large California highway network with 11,160 sensor locations is demonstrated. An overlapping-nodes approach for the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN is developed to include sensor locations from partitions that are geographically close to a given partition. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the DCRNN model can be used to forecast the speed and flow simultaneously and that the forecasted values preserve fundamental traffic flow dynamics. This approach to developing DCRNN models that represent large highway networks can be a potential core capability in advanced highway traffic monitoring systems, where a trained DCRNN model forecasting traffic at all sensor locations can be used to adjust traffic management strategies proactively based on anticipated future conditions.},

	abstract = {Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) have become an increasingly active field of research. It models the spatial dependencies of nodes in a graph with a pre-defined Laplacian matrix based on node distances. However, in many application scenarios, spatial dependencies change over time, and the use of fixed Laplacian matrix cannot capture the change. To track the spatial dependencies among traffic data, we propose a dynamic spatio-temporal GCNN for accurate traffic forecasting. The core of our deep learning framework is the finding of the change of Laplacian matrix with a dynamic Laplacian matrix estimator. To enable timely learning with a low complexity, we creatively incorporate tensor decomposition into the deep learning framework, where real-time traffic data are decomposed into a global component that is stable and depends on long-term temporal-spatial traffic relationship and a local component that captures the traffic fluctuations. We propose a novel design to estimate the dynamic Laplacian matrix of the graph with above two components based on our theoretical derivation, and introduce our design basis. The forecasting performance is evaluated with two realtime traffic datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that our network can achieve up to 25\% accuracy improvement.},

	abstract = {Traffic flow forecasting is widely regarded as an essential gear in the complex machinery underneath Intelligent Transport Systems, being a critical component of avant-garde Automated Traffic Management Systems. Research in this area has stimulated a vibrant activity, yielding a plethora of new forecasting methods contributed to the community on a yearly basis. Efforts in this domain are mainly oriented to the development of prediction models featuring with ever-growing levels of performances and/or computational efficiency. After the swerve towards Artificial Intelligence that gradually took place in the modeling sphere of traffic forecasting, predictive schemes have ever since adopted all the benefits of applied machine learning, but have also incurred some caveats. The adoption of highly complex, black-box models has subtracted comprehensibility to forecasts: even though they perform better, they are more obscure to ITS practitioners, which hinders their practicality. In this paper we propose the adoption of explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) tools that are currently being used in other domains, in order to extract further knowledge from black-box traffic forecasting models. In particular we showcase the utility of xAI to unveil the knowledge extracted by Random Forests and Recurrent Neural Networks when predicting real traffic. The obtained results are insightful and suggest that the traffic forecasting model should be analyzed from more points of view beyond that of prediction accuracy or any other regression score alike, due to the treatment each algorithm gives to input variables: even with the same nominal score value, some methods can take advantage of inner knowledge that others instead disregard.},

recursively passing neural messages along edges of the input graph. However, incorporating both graph structure and feature information leads to complex models,
and explaining predictions made by GNNs remains unsolved. Here
we propose GNNExplainer, the first general, model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for predictions of any GNN-based model on any graph-based machine learning task. Given an instance, GNNExplainer identifies a compact subgraph structure and a small subset of node features that have a crucial role in GNN's prediction. 
Further, GNNExplainer  can generate consistent and concise explanations for an entire class of instances.
We formulate GNNExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information between a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our approach can identify important graph structures as well as node features, and outperforms baselines by 17.1\% on average. GNNExplainer  provides a variety of benefits, from the ability to visualize semantically relevant structures to interpretability, to giving insights into errors of faulty GNNs.},

We take the automatic relevance determination (ARD) view and devise a network to exploit the exogenous variables in addition to time series. In particular, our ARD network can incorporate the uncertainty of the exogenous variables and eventually helps identify useful exogenous variables and suppress those irrelevant for forecasting. The distribution of multi-step ahead forecasts are approximated by Monte Carlo simulation. We show in experiments that our model produces accurate and sharp probabilistic forecasts. The estimated uncertainty of our forecasting also realistically increases over time, in a spontaneous manner.},

This is largely due to the complex, non-Euclidean structure of graphs, which limits possible manipulation operations. Augmentation operations commonly used in vision and language have no analogs for graphs.  Our work studies graph data augmentation for graph neural networks (GNNs) in the context of improving semi-supervised node-classification.  We discuss practical and theoretical motivations, considerations and strategies for graph data augmentation.  Our work shows that neural edge predictors can effectively encode class-homophilic structure to promote intra-class edges and demote inter-class edges in given graph structure, and our main contribution introduces the GAug graph data augmentation framework, which leverages these insights to improve performance in GNN-based node classification via edge prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that augmentation via GAug improves performance across GNN architectures and datasets.},

	abstract = {Predicting urban traffic is of great importance to intelligent transportation systems and public safety, yet is very challenging in three aspects: 1) complex spatio-temporal correlations of urban traffic, including spatial correlations between locations along with temporal correlations among timestamps; 2) spatial diversity of such spatio-temporal correlations, which varies from location to location and depends on the surrounding geographical information, e.g., points of interests and road networks; and 3) temporal diversity of such spatio-temporal correlations, which is highly influenced by dynamic traffic states. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep meta learning based model, entitled ST-MetaNet⁺+, to collectively predict traffic in all locations at the same time. ST-MetaNet⁺+ employs a sequence-to-sequence architecture, consisting of an encoder to learn historical information and a decoder to make predictions step by step. Specifically, the encoder and decoder have the same network structure, consisting of meta graph attention networks and meta recurrent neural networks, to capture diverse spatial and temporal correlations, respectively. Furthermore, the weights (parameters) of meta graph attention networks and meta recurrent neural networks are generated from the embeddings of geo-graph attributes and the traffic context learned from dynamic traffic states. Extensive experiments were conducted based on three real-world datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of ST-MetaNet⁺+ beyond several state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) models are proposed to deal with the spatial-temporal network data forecasting problem. These STGCN models have their own advantages, i.e., each of them puts forward many effective operations and achieves good prediction results in the real applications. If users can effectively utilize and combine these excellent operations integrating the advantages of existing models, then they may obtain more effective STGCN models thus create greater value using existing work. However, they fail to do so due to the lack of domain knowledge, and there is lack of automated system to help users to achieve this goal. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose Auto-STGCN algorithm, which makes use of existing models to automatically explore high-performance STGCN model for specific scenarios. Specifically, we design Unified-STGCN framework, which summarizes the operations of existing architectures, and use parameters to control the usage and characteristic attributes of each operation, so as to realize the parameterized representation of the STGCN architecture and the reorganization and fusion of advantages. Then, we present Auto-STGCN, an optimization method based on reinforcement learning, to quickly search the parameter search space provided by Unified-STGCN, and generate optimal STGCN models automatically. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that our Auto-STGCN can find STGCN models superior to existing STGCN models with heuristic parameters, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Statistical traffic prediction literature has a complete subfield devoted to uncertainty modelling, but recent deep learning traffic prediction models either lack this feature or make specific assumptions that restrict its practicality. We propose Quantile Graph Wavenet, a Spatio-Temporal neural network that is trained to estimate a density given the measurements of previous timesteps, conditioned on a quantile. Our method of density estimation is fully parameterised by our neural network and does not use a likelihood approximation internally. The quantile loss function is asymmetric and this makes it possible to model skewed densities. This approach produces uncertainty estimates without the need to sample during inference, such as in Monte Carlo Dropout, which makes our method also efficient.},

The core of smart cities is the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) which has been integrated into several smart city applications that improve transportation and mobility. ITS aims to resolve many traffic issues, such as traffic congestion issues. Recently, new traffic flow prediction models and frameworks have been rapidly developed in tandem with the introduction of artificial intelligence approaches to improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction. Traffic forecasting is a crucial duty in the transportation industry. It can significantly affect the design of road constructions and projects in addition to its importance for route planning and traffic rules. Furthermore, traffic congestion is a critical issue in urban areas and overcrowded cities. Therefore, it must be accurately evaluated and forecasted. Hence, a reliable and efficient method for predicting traffic is essential. The main objectives of this study are: First, present a comprehensive review of the most popular machine learning and deep learning techniques applied in traffic prediction. Second, identifying inherent obstacles to applying machine learning and deep learning in the domain of traffic prediction.},

Forecasting the evolution patterns of spatio-temporal data is an important yet demanding aspect of urban computing, which can enhance intelligent management decisions in various fields, including transportation, environment, climate, public safety, healthcare, and others. Traditional statistical and deep learning methods struggle to capture complex correlations in urban spatio-temporal data. To this end, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNN) have been proposed, achieving great promise in recent years. STGNNs enable the extraction of complex spatio-temporal dependencies by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) and various temporal learning methods. In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress on STGNN technologies for predictive learning in urban computing. Firstly, we provide a brief introduction to the construction methods of spatio-temporal graph data and the prevalent deep-learning architectures used in STGNNs. We then sort out the primary application domains and specific predictive learning tasks based on existing literature. Afterward, we scrutinize the design of STGNNs and their combination with some advanced technologies in recent years. Finally, we conclude the limitations of existing research and suggest potential directions for future work.},

However, which kind of deep neural networks is the most appropriate model for traffic flow prediction remains unsolved. In this paper, we use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) neural network (NN) methods to predict short-term traffic flow, and experiments demonstrate that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based deep learning methods such as LSTM and GRU perform better than auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.

	abstract = {Accurately predicting future service traffic would be of great help for load balancing and resource allocation, which plays a key role in guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) in cloud computing. With the rapid development of data center, the large-scale network traffic prediction requires more suitable methods to deal with the complex properties (e.g., high-dimension, long-range dependence, non-linearity, and so on). However, due to the limitations of traditional methods (e.g., strong theoretical assumptions and simple implementation), few research works could predict the large-scale network traffic efficiently and accurately. More importantly, most of the studies took only the temporal features but without the services’ communications into consideration, which may weaken the QoS of applications in the data center. To this end, we applied the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model and the interactive temporal recurrent convolution network (ITRCN) to single-service traffic prediction and interactive network traffic prediction, respectively. Especially, ITRCN takes the communications between services as a whole and directly predicts the interactive traffic in large-scale network. Within the ITRCN model, the convolution neural network (CNN) part learns network traffic as images to capture the network-wide services’ correlations, and the GRU part learns the temporal features to help the interactive network traffic prediction. We conducted comprehensive experiments based on the Yahoo! data sets, and the results show that the proposed novel method outperforms the conventional GRU and CNN method by an improvement of 14.3\% and 13.0\% in root mean square error, respectively.},

However, traffic prediction is a very challenging problem because traffic data are a typical type of spatio-temporal data, which simultaneously shows correlation and heterogeneity both in space and time. Most existing works can only capture the partial properties of traffic data and even assume that the effect of correlation on traffic prediction is globally invariable, resulting in inadequate modeling and unsatisfactory prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model, called ST-3DNet, for traffic raster data prediction. ST-3DNet introduces 3D convolutions to automatically capture the correlations of traffic data in both spatial and temporal dimensions. A novel recalibration (Rc) block is proposed to explicitly quantify the difference of the contributions of the correlations in space. Considering two kinds of temporal properties of traffic data, i.e., local patterns and long-term patterns, ST-3DNet employs two components consisting of 3D convolutions and Rc blocks to, respectively, model the two kinds of patterns and then aggregates them together in a weighted way for the final prediction. The experiments on several real-world traffic datasets, viz., traffic congestion data and crowd flows data, demonstrate that our ST-3DNet outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Traffic prediction has drawn increasing attention in AI research field due to the increasing availability of large-scale traffic data and its importance in the real world. For example, an accurate taxi demand prediction can assist taxi companies in pre-allocating taxis. The key challenge of traffic prediction lies in how to model the complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Although both factors have been considered in modeling, existing works make strong assumptions about spatial dependence and temporal dynamics, i.e., spatial dependence is stationary in time, and temporal dynamics is strictly periodical. However, in practice the spatial dependence could be dynamic (i.e., changing from time to time), and the temporal dynamics could have some perturbation from one period to another period. In this paper, we make two important observations: (1) the spatial dependencies between locations are dynamic; and (2) the temporal dependency follows daily and weekly pattern but it is not strictly periodic for its dynamic temporal shifting. To address these two issues, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Network (STDN), in which a flow gating mechanism is introduced to learn the dynamic similarity between locations, and a periodically shifted attention mechanism is designed to handle long-term periodic temporal shifting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that tackle both issues in a unified framework. Our experimental results on real-world traffic datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Both road users and administrators are keen to know the traffic volume at the arbitrary point on the road network. In China, charging systems have been fully established in closed large-regional freeway networks. They have accumulated massive amounts of toll collection data and provided a possible method to forecast unknown traffic volume at any designated cross-section located on a freeway. A systematic method is proposed to derive the traffic volume step-by-step. First, the average traveling speed is obtained for each vehicle on its shortest path. Then, the traveling time is estimated in each road segment. Finally, the historical traffic volume is derived at the designated cross-section. To make the obtained traffic volume data more practical, a deep learning-based autoencoder is used for forecasting the traffic volume and evaluating its prediction accuracy. All these proposed methods are evaluated with a collection of toll data for one month covering more than 5000 km of freeway under a centralized regional charging system. One location is randomly selected as the designated cross section at 2 km from the upstream toll gate on a road segment of the Xi’an ring. The experimental results show the effectiveness and satisfactory accuracy of predicting the traffic volume in the designated cross-section compared with the data captured by the traffic video detection equipment. Rapid and successful prediction from available toll collection data may provide a practical method for deriving the traffic information without installing any additional regularly maintained detectors and equipment on the freeway.},

	abstract = {Passenger flow prediction has drawn increasing attention in the deep learning research field due to its great importance in traffic management and public safety. The major challenge of this essential task lies in multiple spatiotemporal correlations that exhibit complex non-linear correlations. Although both the spatial and temporal perspectives have been considered in modeling, most existing works have ignored complex temporal correlations or underlying spatial similarity. In this paper, we identify the unique spatiotemporal correlation of urban metro flow, and propose an attention-based deep spatiotemporal network with multi-task learning (ADST-Net) at a citywide level to predict the future flow from historical observations. ADST-Net uses three independent channels with the same structure to model the recent, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic complicated spatiotemporal correlations, respectively. Specifically, each channel uses the framework of residual networks, the rectified block and the multi-scale convolutions to mine spatiotemporal correlations. The residual networks can effectively overcome the gradient vanishing problem. The rectified block adopts an attentional mechanism to automatically reweigh measurements at different time intervals, and the multi-scale convolutions are used to extract explicit spatial relationships. ADST-Net also introduces an external embedding mechanism to extract the influence of external factors on flow prediction, such as weather conditions. Furthermore, we enforce multi-task learning to utilize transition passenger flow volume prediction as an auxiliary task during the training process for generalization. Through this model, we can not only capture the steady trend, but also the sudden changes of passenger flow. Extensive experimental results on two real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate the obvious improvement and superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared with state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, it remains challenging to recognize high fluctuations, nonlinearity, and periodicity of bus passenger flows due to varied destinations and departure times. For this reason, a novel forecasting model named as affinity propagation-based support vector regression (AP-SVR) is proposed based on clustering and nonlinear simulation. For the addressed approach, a clustering algorithm is first used to generate clustering-based intervals. A support vector regression (SVR) is then exploited to forecast the passenger flow for each cluster, with the use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) for obtaining the optimized parameters. Finally, the prediction results of the SVR are rearranged by chronological order rearrangement. The proposed model is tested using real bus passenger data from a bus line over four months. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model performs better than other peer models in terms of absolute percentage error and mean absolute percentage error. It is recommended that the deterministic clustering technique with stable cluster results (AP) can improve the forecasting performance significantly.},

By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning technologies on such data, urban traffic prediction has drawn a lot of attention in AI and Intelligent Transportation System community. The problem can be uniformly modeled with a 3D tensor (T, N, C), where T denotes the total time steps, N denotes the size of the spatial domain (i.e., mesh-grids or graph-nodes), and C denotes the channels of information. According to the specific modeling strategy, the state-of-the-art deep learning models can be divided into three categories: grid-based, graph-based, and multivariate time-series models. In this study, we first synthetically review the deep traffic models as well as the widely used datasets, then build a standard benchmark to comprehensively evaluate their performances with the same settings and metrics. Our study named DL-Traff is implemented with two most popular deep learning frameworks, i.e., TensorFlow and PyTorch, which is already publicly available as two GitHub repositories https://github.com/deepkashiwa20/DL-Traff-Grid and https://github.com/deepkashiwa20/DL-Traff-Graph.

Urban planners have long been concerned by the constant challenges of precisely forecasting traffic patterns. Conventional approaches, which mainly depends on statistical models, continually fails to accurately capture the dynamic and complex nature of vehicular traffic. These techniques encounters difficulties in fully encompassing the complex aspects that influence traffic dynamics. This study explores into the revolutionary potential of deep learning to address the limitations of existing methodologies, notably in addressing the intrinsic complexity of traffic forecast. We explore three different deep learning approaches - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and a mix of both known as Hybrid. This review analyses their utility in decoding spatial and temporal complexities important for attaining accurate prediction. This research also emphasis on most frequently used datasets, acting as benchmark for assessing the robustness of traffic prediction models. This study seeks to impact the direction of future breakthroughs in applying deep learning to traffic prediction, adding to the ongoing refinement of its dynamic sphere.

Typically, specific deep learning models, e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), can be trained on collected transportation data for a particular task. However, traditional deep learning techniques rely on data sufficiency to build an effective model. Additionally, each trained model can only work on one single task. This has limited the efficacy of deep learning techniques in numerous application scenarios. To this end, multi-task learning (MTL) has been studied to train a single model that can work for multiple tasks. This technique effectively allows the learning model to expand to specific tasks with only a limited amount of data affiliated. In the meantime, MTL significantly reduces the training time of each task. The success of MTL requires that there are potential relationships among different tasks. Many tasks in the smart transportation system are related. For instance, traffic speed and vehicle volume estimations for each road are highly correlated. Based on this, research on applying MTL in smart transportation systems has been studied recently. This paper reviews the recent efforts to use MTL in smart transportation systems and conducts an extensive survey to provide insights. In particular, we categorize the MTL applications in smart transportation systems into traffic forecasting, traffic sign recognition, vehicle recognition, travel time estimation, road safety estimation, taxi demand prediction, and autonomous driving. Ultimately, we discuss challenges and future research directions in applying MTL in smart transportation systems.},

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting plays an essential role in modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS) since it is the fundamental component of a wide range of real-life applications like alleviating traffic congestion or public transportation planning. With the pervasive use of sensors deployed in the cities and the evolution of computing resources, it is necessary to carefully explore the information in traffic data to further facilitate traffic applications. However, the complex spatial-temporal dependency of traffic can hardly be fully captured by the classic statistical methods and traditional machine learning methods. Recently, many frameworks based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed to make full use of the abundant spatial information preserved in graph-structured data, and plenty of emerging GNN frameworks have reached state-of-the-art performance. One key advantage of GNNs is their ability to model irregular graphs with local aggregations. Motivated by the success of GNNs achieved in traffic prediction tasks, we present a survey in this paper that provides a summary on GNN-based deep learning approaches in traffic prediction from multiple perspectives. In general, traffic prediction methods based on spatial information often depend on graph construction, spatial information extraction, and spatial-temporal information fusion. We classify current methods by their roles in these steps during the traffic prediction pipeline, giving the advantages of these methods when introducing the detailed methods. At the end, research gap and trend of this discipline of study is summarised to be provided as a guideline for interested researchers.},

	abstract = {It is generally recognized that accurate and timely prediction of future traffic flow information is one of the important conditions for improving the utilization rate of road networks and relieving traffic congestion. Since long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have obvious advantages in dealing with time series data, LSTM-based prediction models, as well as the improved and hybrid models based on LSTM, have been widely used in the field of traffic flow prediction and have achieved a series of important results. However, although some existing reviews have provided a comprehensive summary of and prospects for traffic flow prediction methods, there is no recent review specifically summarizing the traffic flow prediction methods based on LSTM. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive review of LSTM-based methods for traffic flow prediction. First, we briefly introduce the development history of traffic flow prediction, the advantages of using LSTM for traffic flow prediction, and the basic principles of LSTM. Then, the representative model structures, training methods, public datasets, attractive results, the advantages and disadvantages of different LSTM-based methods are presented and analyzed in detail. Furthermore, to illustrate the performance of various refinements and hybrid models based on LSTM for traffic flow prediction, we meticulously select several representative approaches to conduct comparative experiments and quantitative analysis. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and challenges of LSTM and traffic flow prediction and present potential areas of future research interest to the readers.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, modern transportation systems have employed various cutting-edge deep-learning approaches for traffic flow prediction. Due to its significant temporal correlations, researchers have mainly focused on extracting temporal features from traffic flow data. As a result, time-series models based on deep learning methods like Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) have been introduced as solutions for traffic flow prediction. However, the spatial features of the road network have also shown an impact on the prediction, leading to the application of deep learning methods on spatial dependency modeling for this problem. This paper defines the traffic flow forecasting problem, considering both time-series information with and without spatial information and the corresponding techniques of current solutions to depict spatio-temporal traffic dependency. We propose a new taxonomy of spatial and temporal dependencies in the fine-grained subcategory and the methods depicting them based on neural network-based models. Furthermore, we highlight the architecture of spatial and temporal ensembles in Spatio-temporal modelling based on the fine-grained categories obtained. We point out several open issues and future directions of traffic flow forecasting, such as graph reconstruction, temporal and spatial information data balance, and multi-model spatial and temporal correlations.},

	abstract = {The development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has brought about comprehensive urban traffic information that not only provides convenience to urban residents in their daily lives but also enhances the efficiency of urban road usage, leading to a more harmonious and sustainable urban life. Typical scenarios in ITS mainly include traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. However, most current ITS applications rely on a centralized training approach where users upload source data to a cloud server with high computing power for management and centralized training. This approach has limitations such as poor real-time performance, data silos, and difficulty in guaranteeing data privacy. To address these limitations, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the application of FL in ITS, with a particular focus on three key scenarios: traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. For each scenario, we provide an in-depth analysis of its key characteristics, current challenges, and specific manners in which FL is leveraged. Moreover, we discuss the benefits that FL can offer as a potential solution to the limitations of the centralized training approach currently used in ITS applications.},

Navigating the intricacies of modeling the intricate interaction among these elements, creating universal representations, and employing them to address transportation issues. Yet, these intricacies comprise just one facet of the multifaceted trials confronting contemporary ITS. This paper offers an all-encompassing survey exploring Deep learning (DL) utilization in ITS, primarily focusing on practitioners' methodologies to address these multifaceted challenges. The emphasis lies on the architectural and problem-specific factors that guide the formulation of innovative solutions. In addition to shedding light on the state-of-the-art DL algorithms, we also explore potential applications of DL and large language models (LLMs) in ITS, including traffic flow prediction, vehicle detection and classification, road condition monitoring, traffic sign recognition, and autonomous vehicles. Besides, we identify several future challenges and research directions that can push the boundaries of ITS, including the critical aspects, including transfer learning, hybrid models, privacy and security, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication. Our aim for this survey is to bridge the gap between the burgeoning DL and transportation communities. By doing so, we aim to facilitate a deeper comprehension of the challenges and possibilities within this field.

Graph WaveNet (GWN) is a spatio-temporal graph neural network which interleaves graph convolution to aggregate information from nearby sensors and dilated convolutions to aggregate information from the past. We improve GWN by (1) using better hyperparameters, (2) adding connections that allow larger gradients to flow back to the early convolutional layers, and (3) pretraining on an easier short-term traffic prediction task. These modifications reduce the mean absolute error by .06 on the METR-LA task, nearly equal to GWN's improvement over its predecessor. These improvements generalize to the PEMS-BAY dataset, with similar relative magnitude. We also show that ensembling separate models for short-and long-term predictions further improves performance.

Existing approaches mostly capture the static spatial dependency relying on the prior knowledge of the graph structure. However, the spatial dependency can be dynamic, and sometimes the physical structure may not reflect the genuine relationship between roads. To better capture the complex spatial-temporal dependencies and forecast traffic conditions on road networks, a multi-step prediction model named Spatial-Temporal Attention Wavenet (STAWnet) is proposed. Temporal convolution is applied to handle long time sequences, and the dynamic spatial dependencies between different nodes can be captured using the self-attention network. Different from existing models, STAWnet does not need prior knowledge of the graph by developing a self-learned node embedding. These components are integrated into an end-to-end framework. The experimental results on three public traffic prediction datasets (METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and PEMS07) demonstrate effectiveness. In particular, in the 1 h ahead prediction, STAWnet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with no prior knowledge of the network.},

Often, these variates are structured, i.e. they are localised in an abstract space, usually representing an aspect of the physical world, and prediction amounts to a form of diffusion of the information across that space over time. Several neural network models of diffusion have been proposed in the literature. However, most of the existing proposals rely on some a priori knowledge on the structure of the space, usually in the form of a graph weighing the pairwise diffusion capacity of its points. We argue that this piece of information can often be dispensed with, since data already contains the diffusion capacity information, and in a more reliable form than that obtained from the usually largely hand-crafted graphs. We propose instead a fully data-driven model which does not rely on such a graph, nor any other prior structural information. We conduct a first set of experiments to measure the impact on performance of a structural prior, as used in baseline models, and show that, except at very low data levels, it remains negligible, and beyond a threshold, it may even become detrimental. We then investigate, through a second set of experiments, the capacity of our model in two respects: treatment of missing data and domain adaptation.},

	abstract = {Traffic Prediction based on graph structures is a challenging task given that road networks are typically complex structures and the data to be analyzed contains variable temporal features. Further, the quality of the spatial feature extraction is highly dependent on the weight settings of the graph structures. In the transportation field, the weights of these graph structures are currently calculated based on factors like the distance between roads. However, these methods do not take into account the characteristics of the road itself or the correlations between different traffic flows. Existing approaches usually pay more attention to local spatial dependencies extraction while global spatial dependencies are ignored. Another major problem is how to extract sufficient information at limited depth of graph structures. To address these challenges, we propose a Random Graph Diffusion Attention Network (RGDAN) for traffic prediction. RGDAN comprises a graph diffusion attention module and a temporal attention module. The graph diffusion attention module can adjust its weights by learning from data like a CNN to capture more realistic spatial dependencies. The temporal attention module captures the temporal correlations. Experiments on three large-scale public datasets demonstrate that RGDAN produces predictions with 2\%–5\% more precision than state-of-the-art methods.},

Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for the applications of smart cities, i.e., intelligent traffic management and urban planning. Although various methods are proposed for spatio-temporal modeling, they ignore the dynamic characteristics of correlations among locations on road network. Meanwhile, most Recurrent Neural Network based works are not efficient enough due to their recurrent operations. Additionally, there is a severe lack of fair comparison among different methods on the same datasets. To address the above challenges, in this article, we propose a novel traffic prediction framework, named Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DGCRN). In DGCRN, hyper-networks are designed to leverage and extract dynamic characteristics from node attributes, while the parameters of dynamic filters are generated at each time step. We filter the node embeddings and then use them to generate dynamic graph, which is integrated with pre-defined static graph. As far as we know, we are first to employ a generation method to model fine topology of dynamic graph at each time step. Furthermore, to enhance efficiency and performance, we employ a training strategy for DGCRN by restricting the iteration number of decoder during forward and backward propagation. Finally, a reproducible standardized benchmark and a brand new representative traffic dataset are opened for fair comparison and further research. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms 15 baselines consistently. Source codes are available at .},

Rich-context representations learned through such reconstruction could be seamlessly integrated by downstream predictors with arbitrary architectures to augment their performances.

	abstract = {Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have become increasingly popular MTS forecasting methods. STGNNs jointly model the spatial and temporal patterns of MTS through graph neural networks and sequential models, significantly improving the prediction accuracy. But limited by model complexity, most STGNNs only consider short-term historical MTS data, such as data over the past one hour. However, the patterns of time series and the dependencies between them (i.e., the temporal and spatial patterns) need to be analyzed based on long-term historical MTS data. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, in which STGNN is Enhanced by a scalable time series Pre-training model (STEP). Specifically, we design a pre-training model to efficiently learn temporal patterns from very long-term history time series (e.g., the past two weeks) and generate segment-level representations. These representations provide contextual information for short-term time series input to STGNNs and facilitate modeling dependencies between time series. Experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework is capable of significantly enhancing downstream STGNNs, and our pre-training model aptly captures temporal patterns.},

	abstract = {We all depend on mobility, and vehicular transportation affects the daily lives of most of us. Thus, the ability to forecast the state of traffic in a road network is an important functionality and a challenging task. Traffic data is often obtained from sensors deployed in a road network. Recent proposals on spatial-temporal graph neural networks have achieved great progress at modeling complex spatial-temporal correlations in traffic data, by modeling traffic data as a diffusion process. However, intuitively, traffic data encompasses two different kinds of hidden time series signals, namely the diffusion signals and inherent signals. Unfortunately, nearly all previous works coarsely consider traffic signals entirely as the outcome of the diffusion, while neglecting the inherent signals, which impacts model performance negatively. To improve modeling performance, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Framework (DSTF) that separates the diffusion and inherent traffic information in a data-driven manner, which encompasses a unique estimation gate and a residual decomposition mechanism. The separated signals can be handled subsequently by the diffusion and inherent modules separately. Further, we propose an instantiation of DSTF, Decoupled Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (D2STGNN), that captures spatial-temporal correlations and also features a dynamic graph learning module that targets the learning of the dynamic characteristics of traffic networks. Extensive experiments with four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the framework is capable of advancing the state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {As an indispensable part in Intelligent Traffic System (ITS), the task of traffic forecasting inherently subjects to the following three challenging aspects. First, traffic data are physically associated with road networks, and thus should be formatted as traffic graphs rather than regular grid-like tensors. Second, traffic data render strong spatial dependence, which implies that the nodes in the traffic graphs usually have complex and dynamic relationships between each other. Third, traffic data demonstrate strong temporal dependence, which is crucial for traffic time series modeling. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named Structure Learning Convolution (SLC) that enables to extend the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) to graph domains and learn the graph structure for traffic forecasting. Technically, SLC explicitly models the structure information into the convolutional operation. Under this framework, various non-Euclidean CNN methods can be considered as particular instances of our formulation, yielding a flexible mechanism for learning on the graph. Along this technical line, two SLC modules are proposed to capture the global and local structures respectively and they are integrated to construct an end-to-end network for traffic forecasting. Additionally, in this process, Pseudo three Dimensional convolution (P3D) networks are combined with SLC to capture the temporal dependencies in traffic data. Extensively comparative experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate our proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.},

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting is of great importance for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Because of the intricacy implied in traffic behavior and the non-Euclidean nature of traffic data, it is challenging to give an accurate traffic prediction. Despite that previous studies considered the relationship between different nodes, the majority have relied on a static representation and failed to capture the dynamic node interactions over time. Additionally, prior studies employed RNN-based models to capture the temporal dependency. While RNNs are a popular choice for forecasting problems, they tend to be memory hungry and slow to train. Furthermore, recent studies start utilizing similarity algorithms to better express the implication of a node over the other. However, to our knowledge, none have explored the contribution of node i’s past, over the future state of node j. In this paper, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Graph Mixformer (STGM) network, a highly optimized model with low memory footprint. We address the aforementioned limits by utilizing a novel attention mechanism to capture the correlation between temporal and spatial dependencies. Specifically, we use convolution layers with a variable fields of view for each head to capture long–short term temporal dependency. Additionally, we train an estimator model that express the contribution of a node over the desired prediction. The estimation is fed alongside a distance matrix to the attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we use a gated mechanism and a mixer layer to further select and incorporate the different perspectives. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model enjoys a performance gain compared to the baselines while maintaining the lowest parameter counts.},

	abstract = {Modeling multivariate time series has long been a subject that has attracted researchers from a diverse range of fields including economics, finance, and traffic. A basic assumption behind multivariate time series forecasting is that its variables depend on one another but, upon looking closely, it is fair to say that existing methods fail to fully exploit latent spatial dependencies between pairs of variables. In recent years, meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown high capability in handling relational dependencies. GNNs require well-defined graph structures for information propagation which means they cannot be applied directly for multivariate time series where the dependencies are not known in advance. In this paper, we propose a general graph neural network framework designed specifically for multivariate time series data. Our approach automatically extracts the uni-directed relations among variables through a graph learning module, into which external knowledge like variable attributes can be easily integrated. A novel mix-hop propagation layer and a dilated inception layer are further proposed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies within the time series. The graph learning, graph convolution, and temporal convolution modules are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on 3 of 4 benchmark datasets and achieves on-par performance with other approaches on two traffic datasets which provide extra structural information.},

	abstract = {Long-term traffic prediction is highly challenging due to the complexity of traffic systems and the constantly changing nature of many impacting factors. In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal factors, and propose a graph multi-attention network (GMAN) to predict traffic conditions for time steps ahead at different locations on a road network graph. GMAN adapts an encoder-decoder architecture, where both the encoder and the decoder consist of multiple spatio-temporal attention blocks to model the impact of the spatio-temporal factors on traffic conditions. The encoder encodes the input traffic features and the decoder predicts the output sequence. Between the encoder and the decoder, a transform attention layer is applied to convert the encoded traffic features to generate the sequence representations of future time steps as the input of the decoder. The transform attention mechanism models the direct relationships between historical and future time steps that helps to alleviate the error propagation problem among prediction time steps. Experimental results on two real-world traffic prediction tasks (i.e., traffic volume prediction and traffic speed prediction) demonstrate the superiority of GMAN. In particular, in the 1 hour ahead prediction, GMAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 4\% improvement in MAE measure.

Thus, many governments have issued restrictions for car-hailing services and alleged that the use of unlicensed vehicles was illegal. However, it is very challenging that traffic administrative enforcements face limited manpower to prohibit unlicensed taxis, due to costly and time-consuming procedure of on-site evidence collection. In this paper, we propose an effective service to incorporate human mobility mechanism into unlicensed taxis detection from massive city-wide vehicles. We first extract 276 spatio-temporal features, which are grouped into two categories, including daily behaviors and sustainable behaviors to capture the mobility characteristics of unlicensed taxis. Second, we investigate the detection accuracy of three machine learning techniques, viz. support vector machines, decision tree, and logical regression. We illustrate our approach using real-world vehicle license plate recognition dataset in Xiamen, China, which contains 336 million passing records for 6.2 million vehicles filmed by 439 devices in August 2016. Experimental results reveal that LR outperforms SVM and DT in prediction accuracy and F-score measurement, while SVM is capable of identifying the largest number of unlicensed taxis.},

	abstract = {Multivariate time series forecasting poses challenges as the variables are intertwined in time and space, like in the case of traffic signals. Defining signals on graphs relaxes such complexities by representing the evolution of signals over a space using relevant graph kernels such as the heat diffusion kernel. However, this kernel alone does not fully capture the actual dynamics of the data as it only relies on the graph structure. The gap can be filled by combining the graph kernel representation with data-driven models that utilize historical data. This paper proposes a traffic propagation model that merges multiple heat diffusion kernels into a data-driven prediction model to forecast traffic signals. We optimize the model parameters using Bayesian inference to minimize the prediction errors and, consequently, determine the mixing ratio of the two approaches. Such mixing ratio strongly depends on training data size and data anomalies, which typically correspond to the peak hours for traffic data. The proposed model demonstrates prediction accuracy comparable to that of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks with lower computational effort. It notably achieves excellent performance for long-term prediction through the inheritance of periodicity modeling in data-driven models.},

	abstract = {Spatial-temporal forecasting has attracted tremendous attention in a wide range of applications, and traffic flow prediction is a canonical and typical example. The complex and long-range spatial-temporal correlations of traffic flow bring it to a most intractable challenge. Existing works typically utilize shallow graph convolution networks (GNNs) and temporal extracting modules to model spatial and temporal dependencies respectively. However, the representation ability of such models is limited due to: (1) shallow GNNs are incapable to capture long-range spatial correlations, (2) only spatial connections are considered and a mass of semantic connections are ignored, which are of great importance for a comprehensive understanding of traffic networks. To this end, we propose Spatial-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential Equation Networks (STGODE).1 Specifically, we capture spatial-temporal dynamics through a tensor-based ordinary differential equation (ODE), as a result, deeper networks can be constructed and spatial-temporal features are utilized synchronously. To understand the network more comprehensively, semantical adjacency matrix is considered in our model, and a well-design temporal dialated convolution structure is used to capture long term temporal dependencies. We evaluate our model on multiple real-world traffic datasets and superior performance is achieved over state-of-the-art baselines.},

Existing frameworks typically utilize given spatial adjacency graph and sophisticated mechanisms for modeling spatial and temporal correlations. However, limited representations of given spatial graph structure with incomplete adjacent connections may restrict effective spatial-temporal dependencies learning of those models. To overcome those limitations, our paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Networks (STFGNN) for traffic flow forecasting. SFTGNN could effectively learn hidden spatial-temporal dependencies by a novel fusion operation of various spatial and temporal graphs, which is generated by a data-driven method. Meanwhile, by integrating this fusion graph module and a novel gated convolution module into a unified layer, SFTGNN could handle long sequences.

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting is crucial for public safety and resource optimization, yet is very challenging due to the temporal changes and the dynamic spatial correlations of the traffic data. To capture these intricate dependencies, spatio-temporal networks, such as recurrent neural networks with graph convolution networks, graph convolution networks with temporal convolution networks, and temporal attention networks with full graph attention networks, are applied. However, previous spatio-temporal networks are based on end-to-end training and thus fail to handle the distribution shift in the non-stationary traffic time series. On the other hand, the efficient and effective algorithm for modeling spatial correlations is still lacking in prior networks.In this paper, rather than proposing yet another end-to-end model, we aim to provide a novel disentangle-fusion framework STWave to mitigate the distribution shift issue. The framework first decouples the complex traffic data into stable trends and fluctuating events, followed by a dual-channel spatio-temporal network to model trends and events, respectively. Finally, reasonable future traffic can be predicted through the fusion of trends and events. Besides, we incorporate a novel query sampling strategy and graph wavelet-based graph positional encoding into the full graph attention network to efficiently and effectively model dynamic spatial correlations. Extensive experiments on six traffic datasets show the superiority of our approach, i.e., the higher forecasting accuracy with lower computational cost.},

	abstract = {As a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, traffic flow prediction has a wide range of applications. The fundamental challenge in traffic flow prediction is to effectively model the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data. Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have emerged as one of the most promising methods to solve this problem. However, GNN-based models have three major limitations for traffic prediction: i) Most methods model spatial dependencies in a static manner, which limits the ability to learn dynamic urban traffic patterns; ii) Most methods only consider short-range spatial information and are unable to capture long-range spatial dependencies; iii) These methods ignore the fact that the propagation of traffic conditions between locations has a time delay in traffic systems. To this end, we propose a novel Propagation Delay-aware dynamic long-range transFormer, namely PDFormer, for accurate traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we design a spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Then, two graph masking matrices are introduced to highlight spatial dependencies from short- and long-range views. Moreover, a traffic delay-aware feature transformation module is proposed to empower PDFormer with the capability of explicitly modeling the time delay of spatial information propagation. Extensive experimental results on six real-world public traffic datasets show that our method can not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational efficiency. Moreover, we visualize the learned spatial-temporal attention map to make our model highly interpretable.},

Its key challenge lies in how to integrate diverse factors (such as temporal rules and spatial dependencies) to infer the evolution trend of traffic flow. To address this problem, we propose a unified neural network called Attentive Traffic Flow Machine (ATFM), which can effectively learn the spatial-temporal feature representations of traffic flow with an attention mechanism. In particular, our ATFM is composed of two progressive Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM [1]) units connected with a convolutional layer. Specifically, the first ConvLSTM unit takes normal traffic flow features as input and generates a hidden state at each time-step, which is further fed into the connected convolutional layer for spatial attention map inference. The second ConvLSTM unit aims at learning the dynamic spatial-temporal representations from the attentionally weighted traffic flow features. Further, we develop two deep learning frameworks based on ATFM to predict citywide short-term/long-term traffic flow by adaptively incorporating the sequential and periodic data as well as other external influences. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for traffic flow prediction. Moreover, to verify the generalization of our method, we also apply the customized framework to forecast the passenger pickup/dropoff demands in traffic prediction and show its superior performance.

	abstract = {Our daily lives are greatly impacted by traffic conditions, making it essential to have accurate predictions of traffic flow within a road network. Traffic signals used for forecasting are usually generated by sensors along roads, which can be represented as nodes on a graph. These sensors typically produce normal signals representing normal traffic flows and abnormal signals indicating unknown traffic disruptions. Graph convolution networks are widely used for traffic prediction due to their ability to capture correlations between network nodes. However, existing approaches use a predefined or adaptive adjacency matrix that does not accurately reflect real-world relationships between signals. To address this issue, we propose a decomposition dynamic graph convolutional recurrent network (DDGCRN) for traffic forecasting. DDGCRN combines a dynamic graph convolution recurrent network with an RNN-based model that generates dynamic graphs based on time-varying traffic signals, allowing for the extraction of both spatial and temporal features. Additionally, DDGCRN separates abnormal signals from normal traffic signals and models them using a data-driven approach to further improve predictions. Results from our analysis of six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DDGCRN compared to the current state-of-the-art.

	abstract = {Accurate spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting is crucial in aiding traffic managers in implementing control measures and assisting drivers in selecting optimal travel routes. Traditional deep-learning based methods for traffic flow forecasting typically rely on historical data to train their models, which are then used to make predictions on future data. However, the performance of the trained model usually degrades due to the temporal drift between the historical and future data. To make the model trained on historical data better adapt to future data in a fully online manner, this paper conducts the first study of the online test-time adaptation techniques for spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting problems. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Double Correction by Series Decomposition (ADCSD) method, which first decomposes the output of the trained model into seasonal and trend-cyclical parts and then corrects them by two separate modules during the testing phase using the latest observed data entry by entry. In the proposed ADCSD method, instead of fine-tuning the whole trained model during the testing phase, a lite network is attached after the trained model, and only the lite network is fine-tuned in the testing process each time a data entry is observed. Moreover, to satisfy that different time series variables may have different levels of temporal drift, two adaptive vectors are adopted to provide different weights for different time series variables. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow forecasting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADCSD method. The code is available at https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/ADCSD.},

Based on graph neural networks and attention mechanisms, most previous works utilize the transformer architecture to discover spatiotemporal dependencies and dynamic relationships. However, they have not thoroughly considered correlation information among spatiotemporal sequences. In this paper, based on the maximal information coefficient, we present two elaborate spatiotemporal representations, spatial correlation information (SCorr) and temporal correlation information (TCorr). Using SCorr, we propose a correlation information-based spatiotemporal network (CorrSTN) that includes a dynamic graph neural network component for integrating correlation information into spatial structure effectively and a multi-head attention component for modeling dynamic temporal dependencies accurately. Utilizing TCorr, we explore the correlation pattern among different periodic data to identify the most relevant data, and then design an efficient data selection scheme to further enhance model performance. The experimental results on the highway traffic flow (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07 and PEMS08) and metro crowd flow (HZME inflow and outflow) datasets demonstrate that CorrSTN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance. In particular, on the HZME (outflow) dataset, our model makes significant improvements compared with the ASTGNN model by 13.2\%, 15.3\% and 29.3\% in the metrics of MAE, RMSE and MAPE, respectively.},

In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs, and a temporal block for capturing temporal properties. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block.

The PM-DMNet also introduces two prediction methods: Recursive Multi-step Prediction (RMP) and Parallel Multi-step Prediction (PMP), which leverage the time features of the prediction targets to assist in the forecasting process. Furthermore, a transfer attention mechanism is integrated into PMP, transforming historical data features to better align with the predicted target states, thereby capturing trend changes more accurately and reducing errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over existing benchmarks. The source codes are available at: https://github.com/wengwenchao123/PM-DMNet.},

However, when using a GCN for traffic speed prediction, the conventional approach generally assumes the relationship between the sensors as a homogeneous graph and learns an adjacency matrix using the data accumulated by the sensors. However, the spatial correlation between sensors is not specified as one but defined differently from various viewpoints. To this end, we aim to study the heterogeneous characteristics inherent in traffic signal data to learn the hidden relationships between sensors in various ways. Specifically, we designed a method to construct a heterogeneous graph for each module by dividing the spatial relationship between sensors into static and dynamic modules. We propose a network decentralization attention based heterogeneity-aware graph convolution network (HAGCN) method that aggregates the hidden states of adjacent nodes by considering the importance of each channel in a heterogeneous graph. Experimental results on real traffic datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving a 6.35\% improvement over the existing model and realizing state-of-the-art prediction performance.},

	abstract = {Real-time and precise traffic flow prediction is vital for the efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Traditional methods often employ graph neural networks (GNNs) with predefined graphs to describe spatial correlations among traffic nodes in urban road networks. However, these pre-defined graphs are limited by existing knowledge and graph generation methodologies, offering an incomplete picture of spatial correlations. While time-varying graphs based on data-driven learning have attempted to address these limitations, they still struggle with adequately capturing the inherent spatial correlations in traffic data. Moreover, most current methods for capturing dynamic temporal correlations rely on a unified calculation scheme using a temporal multi-head self-attention mechanism, which at some level might leads to inaccuracies. In order to overcome these challenges, we have proposed a novel hybrid time-varying graph neural network (HTVGNN) for traffic flow prediction. Firstly, a novel enhanced temporal perception multi-head self-attention mechanism based on time-varying mask enhancement was reported to more accurately model the dynamic temporal dependencies among distinct traffic nodes in the traffic network. Secondly, we have proposed a novel graph learning strategy to concurrently learn both static and dynamic spatial associations between different traffic nodes in road networks. Meanwhile, in order to enhance the learning ability of time-varying graphs, a coupled graph learning mechanism was designed to couple the graphs learned at each time step. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method HTVGNN was demonstrated with four real data sets. Simulation results revealed that HTVGNN achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to the state of the art spatio-temporal graph neural network models. Additionally, the ablation experiment verifies that the coupled graph learning mechanism can effectively improve the long-term prediction performance of HTVGNN.},

Many deep learning models have been proposed to improve the accuracy of CTS forecasting. However, while models have become increasingly complex and computationally intensive, they struggle to improve accuracy. Pursuing a different direction, this study aims instead to enable much more efficient, lightweight models that preserve accuracy while being able to be deployed on resource-constrained devices. To achieve this goal, we characterize popular CTS forecasting models and yield two observations that indicate directions for lightweight CTS forecasting. On this basis, we propose the LightCTS framework that adopts plain stacking of temporal and spatial operators instead of alternate stacking that is much more computationally expensive. Moreover, LightCTS features light temporal and spatial operator modules, called L-TCN and GL-Former, that offer improved computational efficiency without compromising their feature extraction capabilities. LightCTS also encompasses a last-shot compression scheme to reduce redundant temporal features and speed up subsequent computations. Experiments with single-step and multi-step forecasting benchmark datasets show that LightCTS is capable of nearly state-of-the-art accuracy at much reduced computational and storage overheads.},

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

	abstract = {Accurate real-time traffic forecast is critical for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and it serves as the cornerstone of various smart mobility applications. Though this research area is dominated by deep learning, recent studies indicate that the accuracy improvement by developing new model structures is becoming marginal. Instead, we envision that the improvement can be achieved by transferring the ''forecasting-related knowledge" across cities with different data distributions and network topologies. To this end, this paper aims to propose a novel transferable traffic forecasting framework: Domain Adversarial Spatial-Temporal Network (DASTNet). DASTNet is pre-trained on multiple source networks and fine-tuned with the target network's traffic data. Specifically, we leverage the graph representation learning and adversarial domain adaptation techniques to learn the domain-invariant node embeddings, which are further incorporated to model the temporal traffic data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ adversarial multi-domain adaptation for network-wide traffic forecasting problems. DASTNet consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art baseline methods on three benchmark datasets. The trained DASTNet is applied to Hong Kong's new traffic detectors, and accurate traffic predictions can be delivered immediately (within one day) when the detector is available. Overall, this study suggests an alternative to enhance the traffic forecasting methods and provides practical implications for cities lacking historical traffic data. Source codes of DASTNet are available at https://github.com/YihongT/DASTNet.},

	abstract = {Robust prediction of citywide traffic flows at different time periods plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. While previous work has made great efforts to model spatio-temporal correlations, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: i) Most models collectively predict all regions' flows without accounting for spatial heterogeneity, i.e., different regions may have skewed traffic flow distributions. ii) These models fail to capture the temporal heterogeneity induced by time-varying traffic patterns, as they typically model temporal correlations with a shared parameterized space for all time periods. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning (ST-SSL) traffic prediction framework which enhances the traffic pattern representations to be reflective of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with auxiliary self-supervised learning paradigms. Specifically, our ST-SSL is built over an integrated module with temporal and spatial convolutions for encoding the information across space and time. To achieve the adaptive spatio-temporal self-supervised learning, our ST-SSL first performs the adaptive augmentation over the traffic flow graph data at both attribute- and structure-levels. On top of the augmented traffic graph, two SSL auxiliary tasks are constructed to supplement the main traffic prediction task with spatial and temporal heterogeneity-aware augmentation. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SSL consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. Since spatio-temporal heterogeneity widely exists in practical datasets, the proposed framework may also cast light on other spatial-temporal applications.

To tackle this, we introduce Sparse Regression-based Vector Quantization (SVQ), a novel technique that leverages sparse regression for succinct representation, an approach theoretically and practically favored over classical clustering-based vector quantization methods. This approach preserves critical details from the original vectors using a regression model while filtering out noise via sparse design. Moreover, we approximate the sparse regression process using a blend of a two-layer MLP and an extensive codebook. This approach not only substantially cuts down on computational costs but also grants SVQ differentiability and training simplicity, resulting in a notable enhancement of performance. Our empirical studies on five spatial-temporal benchmark datasets demonstrate that SVQ achieves state-of-the-art results. Specifically, on the WeatherBench-S temperature dataset, SVQ improves the top baseline by 7.9\%. In video prediction benchmarks-Human, KTH, and KittiCaltech-it reduces MAE by an average of 9.4\% and improves image quality by 17.3\% (LPIPS).},

	abstract = {Urban time series data forecasting featuring significant contributions to sustainable development is widely studied as an essential task of the smart city. However, with the dramatic and rapid changes in the world environment, the assumption that data obey Independent Identically Distribution is undermined by the subsequent changes in data distribution, known as concept drift, leading to weak replicability and transferability of the model over unseen data. To address the issue, previous approaches typically retrain the model, forcing it to fit the most recent observed data. However, retraining is problematic in that it leads to model lag, consumption of resources, and model re-invalidation, causing the drift problem to be not well solved in realistic scenarios. In this study, we propose a new urban time series prediction model for the concept drift problem, which encodes the drift by considering the periodicity in the data and makes on-the-fly adjustments to the model based on the drift using a meta-dynamic network. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our design significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can be well generalized to existing prediction backbones by reducing their sensitivity to distribution changes.},

Traffic networks are modeled and unified into a graph that integrates spatial and temporal information simultaneously. We further extend graph convolution into tensor space and propose a tensor graph convolution network to extract more discriminating features from spatial-temporal graph data. To reduce the computational burden, we take Tucker tensor decomposition and derive factorized a tensor convolution, which performs separate filtering in small-scale space, time, and feature modes. Besides, we can benefit from noise suppression of traffic data when discarding those trivial components in the process of tensor decomposition. Extensive experiments on two real-world traffic speed datasets demonstrate our method is more effective than those traditional traffic prediction methods, and meantime achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

	abstract = {In traffic forecasting, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which model traffic flows as spatio-temporal graphs, have achieved remarkable performance. However, existing GCN-based methods heuristically define the graph structure as the physical topology of the road network, ignoring potential dependence of the graph structure over traffic data. And the defined graph structure is deterministic, which lacks investigation of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BSTGCN) for traffic prediction. The graph structure in our network is learned from the physical topology of the road network and traffic data in an end-to-end manner, which discovers a more accurate description of the relationship among traffic flows. Moreover, a parametric generative model is proposed to represent the graph structure, which enhances the generalization capability of GCNs. We verify the effectiveness of our method on two real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that BSTGCN attains superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) have become an indispensable component of modern global technological development, as they play a massive role in the accurate statistical estimation of vehicles or individuals commuting to a particular transportation facility at a given time. This provides the perfect backdrop for designing and engineering an adequate infrastructural capacity for transportation analyses. However, traffic prediction remains a daunting task due to the non-Euclidean and complex distribution of road networks and the topological constraints of urbanized road networks. To solve this challenge, this paper presents a traffic forecasting model which combines a graph convolutional network, a gated recurrent unit, and a multi-head attention mechanism to simultaneously capture and incorporate the spatio-temporal dependence and dynamic variation in the topological sequence of traffic data effectively. By achieving 91.8\% accuracy on the Los Angeles highway traffic (Los-loop) test data for 15-min traffic prediction and an R2 score of 85\% on the Shenzhen City (SZ-taxi) test dataset for 15- and 30-min predictions, the proposed model demonstrated that it can learn the global spatial variation and the dynamic temporal sequence of traffic data over time. This has resulted in state-of-the-art traffic forecasting for the SZ-taxi and Los-loop datasets.},

In this paper, traffic flows among adjacent road links in a transportation network are modeled as a Bayesian network. The joint probability distribution between the cause nodes (data utilized for forecasting) and the effect node (data to be forecasted) in a constructed Bayesian network is described as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) whose parameters are estimated via the competitive expectation maximization (CEM) algorithm. Finally, traffic flow forecasting is performed under the criterion of minimum mean square error (mmse). The approach departs from many existing traffic flow forecasting models in that it explicitly includes information from adjacent road links to analyze the trends of the current link statistically. Furthermore, it also encompasses the issue of traffic flow forecasting when incomplete data exist. Comprehensive experiments on urban vehicular traffic flow data of Beijing and comparisons with several other methods show that the Bayesian network is a very promising and effective approach for traffic flow modeling and forecasting, both for complete data and incomplete data.},

It is inspired by the biological systems of humans that tend to focus on the distinctive parts when processing large amounts of information. With the development of deep neural networks, attention mechanism has been widely used in diverse application domains. This paper aims to give an overview of the state-of-the-art attention models proposed in recent years. Toward a better general understanding of attention mechanisms, we define a unified model that is suitable for most attention structures. Each step of the attention mechanism implemented in the model is described in detail. Furthermore, we classify existing attention models according to four criteria: the softness of attention, forms of input feature, input representation, and output representation. Besides, we summarize network architectures used in conjunction with the attention mechanism and describe some typical applications of attention mechanism. Finally, we discuss the interpretability that attention brings to deep learning and present its potential future trends.},

The key to graph-based semisupervised learning is capturing the smoothness of labels or features over nodes exerted by graph structure. Previous methods, spectral methods and spatial methods, devote to defining graph convolution as a weighted average over neighboring nodes, and then learn graph convolution kernels to leverage the smoothness to improve the performance of graph-based semi-supervised learning. One open challenge is how to determine appropriate neighborhood that reflects relevant information of smoothness manifested in graph structure. In this paper, we propose GraphHeat, leveraging heat kernel to enhance low-frequency filters and enforce smoothness in the signal variation on the graph. GraphHeat leverages the local structure of target node under heat diffusion to determine its neighboring nodes flexibly, without the constraint of order suffered by previous methods. GraphHeat achieves state-of-the-art results in the task of graph-based semi-supervised classification across three benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.},

With the help of deep neural networks and big traffic data, we can better understand the latent patterns hidden in the complex transportation networks. The dynamic of the traffic flow on one road not only depends on the sequential patterns in the temporal dimension but also relies on other roads in the spatial dimension. Although there are existing works on predicting the future traffic flow, the majority of them have certain limitations on modeling spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial temporal graph neural network for traffic flow prediction, which can comprehensively capture spatial and temporal patterns. In particular, the framework offers a learnable positional attention mechanism to effectively aggregate information from adjacent roads. Meanwhile, it provides a sequential component to model the traffic flow dynamics which can exploit both local and global temporal dependencies. Experimental results on various real traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Nevertheless, it is very challenging to obtain high prediction accuracy with reasonable computational cost due to the complex spatial dependency on the traffic network and the time-varying traffic patterns. To address these issues, this paper develops a residual graph convolution long short-term memory (RGC-LSTM) model for spatial-temporal data forecasting considering the network topology. This model integrates a new graph convolution operator for spatial modelling on networks and a residual LSTM structure for temporal modelling considering multiple periodicities. The proposed model has few parameters, low computational complexity, and a fast convergence rate. The framework is evaluated on both the 10-min traffic speed data from Shanghai, China and the 5-min Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) traffic flow data. Experiments show the advantages of the proposed approach over various state-of-the-art baselines, as well as consistent performance across different datasets.},

We calculate the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between monitor stations to obtain the initial adjacent matrix and fine-tune it while training. As to the model, we construct a multi-stream feature fusion block (MFFB) module, which includes a three-channel network and the soft-attention mechanism. The three-channel networks are graph convolutional neural network (GCN), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and fully connected neural network (FNN), which are used to extract spatial, temporal and other features, respectively. The soft-attention mechanism is utilized to integrate the obtained features. The MFFB modules are stacked, and a fully connected layer and a convolutional layer are used to make predictions.

The influences of partially missing data and recovered data on the traffic speed forecasting are investigated. A case study of the urban area in Hangzhou, China, is presented, and it is found that the proposed recovery algorithm has the best performance in terms of traffic speed information reconstruction compared to benchmark methods. The case study also shows that using the recovered data acquires higher accuracy and efficiency in the short-term speed forecasting, compared to the case of using the original data without recovery.

We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data. More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic. For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region. We have developed a real-time system based on Microsoft Azure Cloud, called UrbanFlow, providing the crowd flow monitoring and forecasting in Guiyang City of China. In addition, we present an extensive experimental evaluation using two types of crowd flows in Beijing and New York City (NYC), where ST-ResNet outperforms nine well-known baselines.},

	abstract = {In order to reduce driving risk in the rainfall days, developing the variable speed limits (VSL) is effective. However, it is hard to develop suitable VSL aligning with travel speed of mainstream that it affected by the traffic flow, rainfall intensity, individual travel speed, peak hours, working days, random events, and so on. In this paper, the average travel speed and traffic flow of each road section are calculated from the toll collection data of Xi’an Ring Road from May to July in 2018 in Shaanxi Province, China. The weather data are collected and extrapolated to the corresponding road sections. Travel speed, traffic flow, and rainfall intensity are integrated to predict the fluctuation trend of travel speed through the proposed deep belief-radial basis function network. The experimental results show that a significant decrease happens in the travel speed in the rainfall day during peak hours. Furthermore, the deep learning algorithm that considers more factors such as the rainfall intensity and traffic flow could improve the prediction accuracy. Then, a VSL method and an expressway risk coefficient evaluation method based on estimation of average travel speed are proposed. The experimental results show that the variable 85th percentile speed limit method proposed in this paper can reduce the risk of expressway driving. This can promote road safety in the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS) in future.},

This approach is named as NN-ARIMA. Neural Network MLP is employed to capture network-scale co-movement pattern of all traffic flows, and ARIMA is used to further extract location-specific traffic features in the residual time series out of Neural Network. The experiment results show that the postprocessing the residuals of Neural Network by the ARIMA analysis helps to significantly improve accuracy of traffic state prediction by 8.9–13.4\% in term of mean squared error reduction. In order to verify the efficiency of the ARIMA analysis in the postprocessing, Multidimensional Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model is also employed to replace the role of Neural Network in the comparative experiment. Two streams of comparisons, (1) NN vs. NN-ARIMA and (2) MSVR vs. MSVR-ARIMA, are performed and show consistent results. The proposed approach not only can capture network-wide co-movement pattern of traffic flows, but also seize location-specific traffic characteristics as well as sharp nonlinearity of macroscopic traffic variables. The case study indicates that the accuracy of prediction can be significantly improved when both network-scale traffic features and location-specific characteristics are taken into account.},

Accurate traffic flow prediction is of great significance for strengthening urban management and facilitating people’s travel. In this paper, we propose a model named LST-GCN to improve the accuracy of current traffic flow predictions. We simulate the spatiotemporal correlations present in traffic flow prediction by optimizing GCN (graph convolutional network) parameters using an LSTM (long short-term memory) network. Specifically, we capture spatial correlations by learning topology through GCN networks and temporal correlations by embedding LSTM networks into the training process of GCN networks. This method improves the traditional method of combining the recurrent neural network and graph neural network in the original spatiotemporal traffic flow prediction, so it can better capture the spatiotemporal features existing in the traffic flow. Extensive experiments conducted on the PEMS dataset illustrate the effectiveness and outperformance of our method compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

The complex urban structure leads to irregular shape and layout of the road network, which poses a challenge to capture the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic flow at different nodes in the region. In this study, a graph convolutional network model framework embedded with wavelet decomposition and attention mechanism (WDA-GCN) is proposed to predict the traffic flow of each traffic monitor at the regional level by exploring the spatio-temporal correlation among traffic monitors. Specifically, the spatial correlation between different monitors is encoded into two graphs by Graph Convolutional Network (GCN): geographical neighbor graph and functional similarity graph. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is used to learn the spatial features extracted by GCN, and the attention mechanism is added to improve the prediction accuracy. Finally, the time series data and spatio-temporal correlation of traffic flow are input into the encoder–decoder based on GRU to realize regional traffic flow prediction. The model is validated and compared with the real traffic monitor data in Daxing District of Beijing, China, and the results show that the prediction accuracy of WDA-GCN model can reach 81.03\% after embedding wavelet decomposition and attention mechanism, which is better than the traditional time series prediction methods and deep learning methods.},

The federated community GCN (FCGCN) can achieve timely, accurate, and safe traffic state predictions in the era of big traffic data, which is critical for the efficient operation of intelligent transportation systems. The FCGCN prediction process has four steps: dividing the local subnetwork with community detection, local training based on the global parameters, uploading the local model parameters, and constructing a global model prediction based on the aggregated parameters. Numerical results on the PeMS04 and PeMS08 datasets show that the FCGCN outperforms four benchmark models, namely, the long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), ChebNet, and graph attention network (GAT) models. The FCGCN prediction is closer to the real value, with nearly the same performance as the global model at a lower time cost, thus achieving accurate and secure short-term traffic flow predictions with three parameters: flow, speed, and occupancy.},

Firstly, built on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we develop an attention-based Conv-LSTM module to extract the spatial and short-term temporal features. The attention mechanism is properly designed to distinguish the importance of flow sequences at different times by automatically assigning different weights. Secondly, to further explore long-term temporal features, we propose a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) module to extract daily and weekly periodic features so as to capture variance tendency of the traffic flow from both previous and posterior directions. Finally, extensive experimental results are presented to show that the proposed model combining the attention Conv-LSTM and Bi-LSTM achieves better prediction performance compared with other existing approaches.},

As well, the traffic flow of the target road section to be predicted is also closely related to the adjacent road sections. Therefore, in this paper, a prediction method based on the combination of multiple linear regression and Long-Short-Term Memory (MLR-LSTM) is proposed, which uses the incomplete traffic flow data in the past period of time of the target prediction section and the continuous and complete traffic flow data in the past period of time of each adjacent section to jointly predict the traffic flow changes of the target section in a short time. The accurate prediction of future traffic flow changes can be solved based on the model supposed when the traffic flow data of the target road section is partially missing in the past period of time. The accuracy of the prediction results is the same as that of the current mainstream prediction results based on continuous and non-missing target link flow data. Meanwhile, there is a small-scale improvement when the data time interval is short enough. In the case of frequent maintenance of cameras in actual traffic sections, the proposed prediction method is more feasible and can be widely used.},

	abstract = {Short-term traffic flow forecasting is a key element in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to provide proactive traffic state information to road network operators. A variety of methods to predict traffic variables in the short-term can be found in the literature, ranging from time-series algorithms, machine learning tools and deep learning methods to a selective hybrid of these approaches. Despite the advances in prediction techniques, a challenging problem that affects the application of such methods in the real world is the prevalence of insufficient data across an entire network. It is rare that extensive historical training data required for model training are available for all the links in a city. In order to address this data insufficiency problem, this paper applies transfer learning techniques to machine learning methods in short-term traffic prediction. All the traffic data used in this paper were collected from Highways England road networks in the UK. The results show that through improving the transferability of machine learning-based models, the computational burden due to the model training process can be significantly reduced and the prediction accuracy under data deficient scenarios can be improved for one-step ahead prediction. However, the prediction accuracy gradually decreases in multi-step ahead prediction. It is also found that the accuracy of the proposed hybrid method is highly dependent upon consistency between datasets but less dependent on geographical attributes of links.},

Although there are promising wireless communication schemes such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication standards, information sharing in ITS still faces challenges such as the V2X communication overload when a large number of vehicles suddenly appeared in one area. This flash crowd situation is mainly due to the uncertainty of traffic especially in the urban areas during traffic rush hours and will significantly increase the V2X communication latency. In order to solve such flash crowd issues, we propose a novel system that can accurately predict the traffic flow and density in the urban area that can be used to avoid the V2X communication flash crowd situation. By combining the existing grid-based and graph-based traffic flow prediction methods, we use a Topological Graph Convolutional Network (ToGCN) followed with a Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) framework to predict future traffic flow and density with temporal correlations. The experimentation on a real-world taxi trajectory traffic data set is performed and the evaluation results prove the effectiveness of our method.},

It is even more challenging for most existing one-step prediction models to make an accurate prediction across multiple future time slots. In this article, we propose a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Generative Adversarial Nets model named SeqST-GAN to perform multi-step Spatial-Temporal crowd flow prediction of a city. Motivated by the success of GAN in video prediction, we for the first time propose an adversarial learning framework by regarding the citywide crowd flow data in successive time slots as “image frames.” Specifically, we first use a Seq2Seq model to generate a sequence of future “frame” predictions based on previous ones. Then, by integrating the generation error with the adversary loss, SeqST-GAN can avoid the blurry prediction issue and make more accurate predictions. To incorporate the external contexts, an external-context gate module called EC-Gate is also proposed to learn region-level representations of the context features. Experiments on two large crowd flow datasets in New York demonstrate that SeqST-GAN improves the prediction performance by a large margin compared with the existing state-of-the-art.},

To capture the complex non-stationary temporal dynamics and spatial correlations in multistep traffic-condition prediction, we propose a novel deep learning framework named attention graph convolutional sequence-to-sequence model (AGC-Seq2Seq). In the proposed deep learning framework, spatial and temporal dependencies are modeled through the Seq2Seq model and graph convolution network separately, and the attention mechanism along with a newly designed training method based on the Seq2Seq architecture is proposed to overcome the difficulty in multistep prediction and further capture the temporal heterogeneity of traffic pattern. We conduct numerical tests to compare AGC-Seq2Seq with other benchmark models using two real-world datasets. The results indicate that our model yields the best prediction performance in terms of various prediction error measures. Furthermore, the variations of spatio-temporal correlations of traffic conditions under different perdition steps and road segments are revealed.},

Forecasting the congestion level of a road network timely can prevent its formation and increase the efficiency and capacity of the road network. However, despite its importance, traffic congestion prediction is not a hot topic among the researcher and traffic engineers. It is due to the lack of high-quality city-wide traffic data and computationally efficient algorithms for traffic prediction. In this paper, we propose (i) an efficient and inexpensive city-wide data acquisition scheme by taking a snapshot of traffic congestion map from an open-source online web service; Seoul Transportation Operation and Information Service (TOPIS), and (ii) a hybrid neural network architecture formed by combing Convolutional Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Transpose Convolutional Neural Network to extract the spatial and temporal information from the input image to predict the network-wide congestion level. Our experiment shows that the proposed model can efficiently and effectively learn both spatial and temporal relationships for traffic congestion prediction.

Different from conventional techniques of temporal link prediction that ignore the potential non-linear characteristics and the informative link weights in the dynamic network, we introduce a novel non-linear model GCN-GAN to tackle the challenging temporal link prediction task of weighted dynamic networks. The proposed model leverages the benefits of the graph convolutional network (GCN), long short-term memory (LSTM) as well as the generative adversarial network (GAN). Thus, the dynamics, topology structure and evolutionary patterns of weighted dynamic networks can be fully exploited to improve the temporal link prediction performance. Concretely, we first utilize GCN to explore the local topological characteristics of each single snapshot and then employ LSTM to characterize the evolving features of the dynamic networks. Moreover, GAN is used to enhance the ability of the model to generate the next weighted network snapshot, which can effectively tackle the sparsity and the wide-value-range problem of edge weights in real-life dynamic networks. To verify the model’s effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on four datasets of different network systems and application scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves impressive results compared to the state-of-the-art competitors.},

	abstract = {Time series has wide applications in the real world and is known to be difficult to forecast. Since its statistical properties change over time, its distribution also changes temporally, which will cause severe distribution shift problem to existing methods. However, it remains unexplored to model the time series in the distribution perspective. In this paper, we term this as Temporal Covariate Shift (TCS). This paper proposes Adaptive RNNs (AdaRNN) to tackle the TCS problem by building an adaptive model that generalizes well on the unseen test data. AdaRNN is sequentially composed of two novel algorithms. First, we propose Temporal Distribution Characterization to better characterize the distribution information in the TS. Second, we propose Temporal Distribution Matching to reduce the distribution mismatch in TS to learn the adaptive TS model. AdaRNN is a general framework with flexible distribution distances integrated. Experiments on human activity recognition, air quality prediction, and financial analysis show that AdaRNN outperforms the latest methods by a classification accuracy of 2.6\% and significantly reduces the RMSE by 9.0\%. We also show that the temporal distribution matching algorithm can be extended in Transformer structure to boost its performance.},

	abstract = {Air pollution and carbon emissions caused by modern transportation are closely related to global climate change. With the help of next-generation information technology such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), accurate traffic flow prediction can effectively solve problems such as traffic congestion and mitigate environmental pollution and climate change. It further promotes the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and smart cities. However, the strong spatial and temporal correlation of traffic data makes the task of accurate traffic forecasting a significant challenge. Existing methods are usually based on graph neural networks using predefined spatial adjacency graphs of traffic networks to model spatial dependencies, ignoring the dynamic correlation of relationships between road nodes. In addition, they usually use independent Spatio-temporal components to capture Spatio-temporal dependencies and do not effectively model global Spatio-temporal dependencies. This paper proposes a new Spatio-temporal Causal Graph Attention Network (STCGAT) for traffic prediction to address the above challenges. In STCGAT, we use a node embedding approach that can adaptively generate spatial adjacency subgraphs at each time step without a priori geographic knowledge and fine-grained modeling of the topology of dynamically generated graphs for different time steps. Meanwhile, we propose an efficient causal temporal correlation component that contains node adaptive learning, graph convolution, and local and global causal temporal convolution modules to learn local and global Spatio-temporal dependencies jointly. Extensive experiments on four real, large traffic datasets show that our model consistently outperforms all baseline models.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an accurate short-term prediction model of bike-sharing demand with the hybrid TCN-GRU method. The emergence of shared bicycles has provided people with a low-carbon, green and healthy way of transportation. However, the explosive growth and free-form development of bike-sharing has also brought about a series of problems in the area of urban governance, creating a new opportunity and challenge in the use of a large amount of historical data for regional bike-sharing traffic flow predictions. In this study, we built an accurate short-term prediction model of bike-sharing demand with the bike-sharing dataset from 2015 to 2017 in London. First, we conducted a multidimensional bike-sharing travel characteristics analysis based on explanatory variables such as weather, temperature, and humidity. This will help us to understand the travel characteristics of local people, will facilitate traffic management and, to a certain extent, improve traffic congestion. Then, the explanatory variables that help predict the demand for bike-sharing were obtained using the Granger causality with the entropy theory-based MIC method to verify each other. The Multivariate Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model were integrated to build the prediction model, and this is abbreviated as the TCN-GRU model. The fitted coefficient of determination R2 and explainable variance score (EVar) of the dataset reached 98.42\% and 98.49\%, respectively. Meanwhile, the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were at least 1.98\% and 2.4\% lower than those in other models. The results show that the TCN-GRU model has strong efficiency and robustness. The model can be used to make short-term accurate predictions of bike-sharing demand in the region, so as to provide decision support for intelligent dispatching and urban traffic safety improvement, which will help to promote the development of green and low-carbon mobility in the future.},

More specifically, GATCN deal with the spatial features by GAT, and the temporal features by TCN. The layer fused by GAT and TCN enables the proposed model to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics that lie in traffic flow, while considering exogenous factors.

In the RL module, we apply the RL algorithm to tune the parameters of our SATP-GAN model. We evaluate the framework on the real-world traffic dataset and obtain a consistent improvement of 6.5\% over baseline methods. The SATP-GAN framework proves the GAN mechanism is also available for time-series prediction after fine-tuning the parameters.},

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting has attracted considerable attention due to its importance in proactive urban traffic control and management. Scholars and engineers have exerted considerable efforts in improving the performance of traffic forecasting algorithms in terms of accuracy, reliability, and efficiency. Spatial feature representation of traffic flow is a core component that greatly influences traffic forecasting performance. In previous studies, several spatial attributes of traffic flow are ignored due to the following issues: a) traffic flow propagation does not comply with the road network, b) the spatial pattern of traffic flow varies over time, and c) single adjacent matrix cannot handle the complex and hierarchical urban traffic flow. To address the abovementioned issues, this study proposes a novel traffic forecasting algorithm called traffic transformer, which achieves great success in natural language processing. The multihead attention mechanism and stacking layers enable the transformer to learn dynamic and hierarchical features in sequential data. Two components, namely, global encoder and global–local decoder, are proposed to extract and fuse the spatial patterns globally and locally. Experimental results indicate that the proposed traffic transformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The learned dynamic and hierarchical features of traffic flow can help achieve a better understanding of spatial dependency of traffic flow for effective and efficient traffic control and management strategies.},

However, it is very challenging because of interactions and spatial correlations between different regions. In addition, it is affected by many factors: i) multiple temporal correlations among different time intervals: closeness, period, trend; ii) complex external influential factors: weather, events; iii) meta features: time of the day, day of the week, and so on. In this paper, we formulate crowd flow forecasting in irregular regions as a spatio-temporal graph (STG) prediction problem in which each node represents a region with time-varying flows. By extending graph convolution to handle the spatial information, we propose using spatial graph convolution to build a multi-view graph convolutional network (MVGCN) for the crowd flow forecasting problem, where different views can capture different factors as mentioned above. We evaluate MVGCN using four real-world datasets (taxicabs and bikes) and extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms the adaptations of state-of-the-art methods. And we have developed a crowd flow forecasting system for irregular regions that can now be used internally.},

However, this is a very challenging problem, affected by multiple complex factors, such as the spatial correlation between different locations, temporal correlation among different time intervals, and external factors (like events and weather). In addition, the flow at a node (called node flow) and transitions between nodes (edge flow) mutually influence each other. To address these issues, we propose a multitask deep-learning framework that simultaneously predicts the node flow and edge flow throughout a spatio-temporal network. Based on fully convolutional networks, our approach designs two sophisticated models for predicting node flow and edge flow, respectively. These two models are connected by coupling their latent representations of middle layers, and trained together. The external factor is also integrated into the framework through a gating fusion mechanism. In the edge flow prediction model, we employ an embedding component to deal with the sparse transitions between nodes. We evaluate our method based on the taxicab data in Beijing and New York City. Experimental results show the advantages of our method beyond 11 baselines, such as ConvLSTM, CNN, and Markov Random Field.},

It aims to model the crowd flow (e.g., inflow and outflow) of each region in a city based on historical observations. Nowadays, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted in raster-based crowd flow analytics by virtue of their capability in capturing spatial dependencies. After revisiting CNN-based methods for different analytics tasks, we expose two common critical drawbacks in the existing uses: 1) inefficiency in learning global spatial dependencies, and 2) overlooking latent region functions. To tackle these challenges, in this paper we present a novel framework entitled DeepLGR that can be easily generalized to address various citywide crowd flow analytics problems. This framework consists of three parts: 1) a local feature extraction module to learn representations for each region; 2) a global context module to extract global contextual priors and upsample them to generate the global features; and 3) a region-specific predictor based on tensor decomposition to provide customized predictions for each region, which is very parameter-efficient compared to previous methods. Extensive experiments on two typical crowd flow analytics tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and generality of our framework.},

This paper models these structures by presenting PredRNN, a new recurrent network, in which a pair of memory cells are explicitly decoupled, operate in nearly independent transition manners, and finally form unified representations of the complex environment. Concretely, besides the original memory cell of LSTM, this network is featured by a zigzag memory flow that propagates in both bottom-up and top-down directions across all layers, enabling the learned visual dynamics at different levels of RNNs to communicate. It also leverages a memory decoupling loss to keep the memory cells from learning redundant features. We further propose a new curriculum learning strategy to force PredRNN to learn long-term dynamics from context frames, which can be generalized to most sequence-to-sequence models. We provide detailed ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of each component. Our approach is shown to obtain highly competitive results on five datasets for both action-free and action-conditioned predictive learning scenarios.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal prediction is challenging due to the complex dynamic motion and appearance changes. Existing work concentrates on embedding additional cells into the standard ConvLSTM to memorize spatial appearances during the prediction. These models always rely on the convolution layers to capture the spatial dependence, which are local and inefficient. However, long-range spatial dependencies are significant for spatial applications. To extract spatial features with both global and local dependencies, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into ConvLSTM. Specifically, a novel self-attention memory (SAM) is proposed to memorize features with long-range dependencies in terms of spatial and temporal domains. Based on the self-attention, SAM can produce features by aggregating features across all positions of both the input itself and memory features with pair-wise similarity scores. Moreover, the additional memory is updated by a gating mechanism on aggregated features and an established highway with the memory of the previous time step. Therefore, through SAM, we can extract features with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we embed the SAM into a standard ConvLSTM to construct a self-attention ConvLSTM (SA-ConvLSTM) for the spatiotemporal prediction. In experiments, we apply the SA-ConvLSTM to perform frame prediction on the MovingMNIST and KTH datasets and traffic flow prediction on the TexiBJ dataset. Our SA-ConvLSTM achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets with fewer parameters and higher time efficiency than previous state-of-the-art method.},

	abstract = {Traffic speed prediction is a critically important component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Recently, with the rapid development of deep learning and transportation data science, a growing body of new traffic speed prediction models have been designed, which achieved high accuracy and large-scale prediction. However, existing studies have two major limitations. First, they predict aggregated traffic speed rather than lane-level traffic speed; second, most studies ignore the impact of other traffic flow parameters in speed prediction. To address these issues, we propose a two-stream multi-channel convolutional neural network (TM-CNN) model for multi-lane traffic speed prediction considering traffic volume impact. In this model, we first introduce a new data conversion method that converts raw traffic speed data and volume data into spatial-temporal multi-channel matrices. Then we carefully design a two-stream deep neural network to effectively learn the features and correlations between individual lanes, in the spatial-temporal dimensions, and between speed and volume. Accordingly, a new loss function that considers the volume impact in speed prediction is developed. A case study using one-year data validates the TM-CNN model and demonstrates its superiority. This paper contributes to two research areas: (1) traffic speed prediction, and (2) multi-lane traffic flow study.},

Sustained and rapid economic growth requires an orderly organization, and planning is an indispensable part of an orderly organization process. The reduction in travel efficiency due to traffic congestion, as well as energy and various pollution issues from the transportation sector, have become the bottleneck for the further development of the city and are the most troublesome topic for governments in all countries. Recently, deep learning performs the excellent ability to extract high dimensional spatial-temporal characters in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on CNN and RNN, which takes matrixed traffic as input, uses CNN to extract traffic characteristics, and uses RNN to predict the evolution of features to achieve traffic flow prediction. Instead of traditional rnn models, we design a new type of RNN structure unit that can process time data in multiple time dimensions at the same time. Using a network-like RNN model, the evolution of traffic flow in different time dimensions is fully considered, and the interaction between different time dimensions is taken into account to predict the traffic flow of the target time series.The prediction of each data in the sequence has real data as input instead of merely taking the output of the previous moment as the input of the next moment.Experiments show that our model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy for real traffic passenger flow datasets.},

In this study, a three-dimensional convolutional network (3D CNN) called TF-3DNet is proposed to achieve the accurate prediction of large-scale traffic flow. The key idea is to use 3D convolution kernel to simultaneously extract and fuse the spatio-temporal features in the traffic flow data. An effective 3D CNN model architecture is explored to ensure that time information is handled in all network layers as spatial information.

	abstract = {In smart cities, region-based prediction (e.g. traffic flow and electricity flow) is of great importance to city management and public safety, and it remains a daunting challenge that involves complicated spatial-temporal-related factors such as weather, holidays, events, etc. Region-based forecasting aims to predict the future situation for regions in a city based on historical data. In the existing literature, the state-of-the-art method solve region-based problems with long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms that extract the temporal view and local convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms that extract the spatial view (local spatial correlation via local CNN). In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method for region-based prediction for smart cities. First, we divide the cities into regions based on the space dimension and model the situation of the cities in 3D volumes. Based on the constructed 3D volumes, we design a model called multiple local 3D CNN spatial-temporal residual networks (LMST3D-ResNet) for region-based prediction in smart cities. LMST3D-ResNet can extract multiple temporal dependencies (including trend, period and closeness) for local regions and then predict the future citywide activities according to the learned multiple spatial-temporal features. LMST3D-ResNet can also combine the spatial-temporal features with external factors. LMST3D-ResNet includes 3D CNNs and ResNet mechanisms for processing spatial-temporal information. In particular, 3D CNNs have the ability to model 3-dimensional information due to 3D convolution and 3D pooling operations, while ResNet enables the connection of the convolutional neural network across layers to obtain a deeper network structure. Specifically, in our proposed model, a novel region-based information extraction mechanism and an end-to-end multiple spatial-temporal dependency learning structure are designed for local regions. Extensive experimental results on two datasets, i.e., MLElectricity and BJTaxi demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the exisiting state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper proposes a hybrid forecasting approach named DeepEnsemble by integrating the three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) with ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). There are four steps in this hybrid approach. First, EEMD is adopted to decompose the complex traffic speed time series data with noise into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue. Second, a three-dimensional tensor is established and fed into 3D CNN for prediction. Third, the output of 3D CNN prediction is obtained by a linear combination of the results of all components. Finally, the 3D CNN prediction output, external features, and historical features are fused to predict the network-wide traffic speed simultaneously. The proposed DeepEnsemble approach is tested on the three-month traffic speed series data of a real-world large-scale urban expressway network with 308 traffic flow detectors in Beijing, China. The experimental results indicate that DeepEnsemble outperforms the state-of-the-art network-wide traffic speed forecasting models. 3D CNN learns temporal, spatial, and depth information better than 2D CNN. Moreover, forecasting accuracy can be improved by employing EEMD. DeepEnsemble is a promising model with scalability and portability for network-wide traffic speed prediction and can be further extended to conduct traffic status monitoring and congestion mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {Recently, for public safety and traffic management, traffic flow prediction is a crucial task. The citywide traffic flow problem is still a big challenge in big cities because of many complex factors. However, to handle some complex factors, e.g., spatial-temporal and some external factors in the intelligent traffic flow forecasting problem, spatial-temporal data for urban applications (i.e., travel time estimation, trajectory planning, taxi demand, traffic congestion, and the regional rainfall) is inherently stochastic and unpredictable. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based novel model called “multi-branching spatial-temporal attention-based long-short term memory residual unit (MBSTALRU)” for the citywide traffic flow from lower-level layers to high-level layers, simultaneously. In our work, initially, we have modeled the traffic flow with spatial correlations multiple 3D volume layers and propose the novel multi-branching scheme to control the spatial-temporal features. Our approach is useful for exploring temporal dependencies through the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) multiple branches, which aim to merge the spatial-temporal characteristics of historical data with three-time intervals, namely closeness, daily, and weekly, and we have embedded features by attention-based long-short term memory (LSTM). Then, we capture the correlation between traffic inflow and outflow with residual layers units. In the end, we merge the external factors dynamically to predict citywide traffic flow simultaneously. The simulation results have been performed on two real-world datasets, BJTaxi and NYCBike, which show better performance and effectiveness of the proposed method than previous state-of-the-art models.},

	abstract = {Predicting vehicle flows is of great importance to traffic management and public safety in smart cities, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as spatio-temporal dependencies with external factors (e.g., holidays, events and weather). Recently, deep learning has shown remarkable performance on traditional challenging tasks, such as image classification, due to its powerful feature learning capabilities. Some works have utilized LSTMs to connect the high-level layers of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the spatio-temporal features, and have shown better performance as compared to many classical methods in traffic prediction. However, these works only build temporal connections on the high-level features at the top layer while leaving the spatio-temporal correlations in the low-level layers not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose to apply 3D CNNs to learn the spatio-temporal correlation features jointly from low-level to high-level layers for traffic data. We also design an end-to-end structure, named as MST3D, especially for vehicle flow prediction. MST3D can learn spatial and multiple temporal dependencies jointly by multiple 3D CNNs, combine the learned features with external factors and assign different weights to different branches dynamically. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework that utilizes 3D CNNs for traffic prediction. Experiments on two vehicle flow datasets Beijing and New York City have demonstrated that the proposed framework, MST3D, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Traffic flow forecasting is of great significance for improving the efficiency of transportation systems and preventing emergencies. Due to the highly non-linearity and intricate evolutionary patterns of short-term and long-term traffic flow, existing methods often fail to take full advantage of spatial-temporal information, especially the various temporal patterns with different period shifting and the characteristics of road segments. Besides, the globality representing the absolute value of traffic status indicators and the locality representing the relative value have not been considered simultaneously. This paper proposes a neural network model that focuses on the globality and locality of traffic networks as well as the temporal patterns of traffic data. The cycle-based dilated deformable convolution block is designed to capture different time-varying trends on each node accurately. Our model can extract both global and local spatial information since we combine two graph convolutional network methods to learn the representations of nodes and edges. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that the model can scrutinize the spatial-temporal correlation of traffic data, and its performance is better than the compared state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis indicates that the locality and globality of the traffic networks are critical to traffic flow prediction and the proposed TSSRGCN model can adapt to the various temporal traffic patterns.},

	abstract = {Accurate real-time traffic forecasting is a core technological problem against the implementation of the intelligent transportation system. However, it remains challenging considering the complex spatial and temporal dependencies among traffic flows. In the spatial dimension, due to the connectivity of the road network, the traffic flows between linked roads are closely related. In the temporal dimension, although there exists a tendency among adjacent time points, the importance of distant time points is not necessarily less than that of recent ones, since traffic flows are also affected by external factors. In this study, an attention temporal graph convolutional network (A3T-GCN) was proposed to simultaneously capture global temporal dynamics and spatial correlations in traffic flows. The A3T-GCN model learns the short-term trend by using the gated recurrent units and learns the spatial dependence based on the topology of the road network through the graph convolutional network. Moreover, the attention mechanism was introduced to adjust the importance of different time points and assemble global temporal information to improve prediction accuracy. Experimental results in real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed A3T-GCN. We observe the improvements in RMSE of 2.51–46.15\% and 2.45–49.32\% over baselines for the SZ-taxi and Los-loop, respectively. Meanwhile, the Accuracies are 0.95–89.91\% and 0.26–10.37\% higher than the baselines for the SZ-taxi and Los-loop, respectively.},

This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal graph attention (ST-GRAT) that effectively captures the spatio-temporal dynamics in road networks. The novel aspects of our approach mainly include spatial attention, temporal attention, and spatial sentinel vectors. The spatial attention takes the graph structure information (e.g., distance between roads) and dynamically adjusts spatial correlation based on road states. The temporal attention is responsible for capturing traffic speed changes, and the sentinel vectors allow the model to retrieve new features from spatially correlated nodes or preserve existing features. The experimental results show that ST-GRAT outperforms existing models, especially in difficult conditions where traffic speeds rapidly change (e.g., rush hours). We additionally provide a qualitative study to analyze when and where ST-GRAT tended to make accurate predictions during rush-hour times.},

Traffic sequence is a typical time series with long temporal dependence. For instance, an emergency may cause traffic congestion for the next several hours. Only a few studies focused on the way to capture long temporal dependence of passenger flow in the rail transit system. Here, an improved model enhanced long-term features based on long-short-term memory (ELF-LSTM) neural network is proposed. It takes full advantages of LSTM Neural Network (LSTM NN) models in processing time series and overcomes its limitations in insufficient learning of long temporal dependency due to time lag. The proposed network strengthens the long temporal dependency features embedded in passenger flow data and incorporates the short-term features to predict the origin destination (OD) flow in the next hour.

In this paper, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, we propose a model named CLM, which is the first to make use of CNN to extract the features of daily and weekly periodicity of traffic speed at the target area and also extract the spatiotemporal features together with the output of CNN by LSTM layers. We conduct comprehensive simulations to assess the performance of our proposed method based on the real-world dataset of Hong Kong. The results indicate that our proposed CLM model can better predict traffic speed in different forecast time periods than the other five competing methods, including SVR, MLP, Lasso, Random forest, and LSTM.},

In this paper, we explore the application of Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) in short-term traffic flow prediction. As a deep learning approach, LSTMs are able to learn more abstract representations in the non-linear traffic flow data. The intrinsic feature of capturing long-term dependencies in a sequential data also makes it a suitable choice in traffic prediction. Experiments on real traffic data sets indicate a good performance of our model. The LSTMs architecture is also compared with state-of-the-art models and experiments show that our model achieves desirable results by lowering the MAPE metrics to 5.4\%.},

Recently, an increasing number of researchers have applied deep learning models to passenger flow prediction. Nevertheless, the task is still challenging due to the complex spatial dependency on the metro network and the time-varying traffic patterns. Therefore, we propose a novel deep learning architecture combining graph attention networks (GAT) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which is called the hybrid GLM (hybrid GAT and LSTM Model). The proposed model captures the spatial dependency via the graph attention layers and learns the temporal dependency via the LSTM layers. Moreover, some external factors are embedded. We tested the hybrid GLM by predicting the metro passenger flow in Shanghai, China. The results are compared with the forecasts from some typical data-driven models. The hybrid GLM gets the smallest root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in different time intervals (TIs), which exhibits the superiority of the proposed model. In particular, in the TI 10 min, the hybrid GLM brings about 6–30\% extra improvements in terms of RMSE. We additionally explore the sensitivity of the model to its parameters, which will aid the application of this model.},

While the predictions for zone-based demand have been extensively studied, much less efforts have been paid to the predictions for origin-destination (OD) based demand (namely, demand originating from one zone to another). However, OD-based demand prediction is even more important and worth further explorations, since it provides more elaborate trip information in the near future as reference for fine-grained operations, such as the routing and matching of shared ride-hailing services that pick up and drop off two or more passengers in each ride. Simultaneous prediction of both zone-based and OD-based demand can be an interesting and practical problem for the ride-hailing platforms. To address the issue, we propose a multi-task matrix factorized graph neural network (MT-MF-GCN), which consists of two major components: (1) a GCN (graph convolutional network) basic module that captures the spatial correlations among zones via mixture-model graph convolutional (MGC) network, and (2) a matrix factorization module for multi-task predictions of zone-based and OD-based demand. By evaluations on the real-world on-demand data in Manhattan and Haikou, we show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in both zone- and OD-based predictions.},

To verify the validity of the model, the ConvLSTM and CNNs models were compared based on their spatiotemporal scale by calculating the spatial structure similarity, root-mean-square-error, and correlation coefficient. The results show that in the entire test set, the single prediction effect of ConvLSTM was better than that of CNNs. Taking 15 December 2018 as an example, ConvLSTM was superior to CNNs in simulating the local variations in the sea ice concentration in the Northeast Passage, particularly in the vicinity of the East Siberian Sea.

The spatial-temporal dependency between traffic locations is often dynamic, which means the correlation between the traffic status of different locations changes jointly over their spatial distance and the time slice they are in. Most of the existing Graph Convolutional Network-based methods usually capture spatial and temporal dependencies separately and then combine them in a parallel or serial mechanism to capture the spatial-temporal features. They always utilize the predefined static graph structure to capture both local correlations and global dependencies in the same time slice. These methods are incapable of directly learning dynamic spatial-temporal dependency across time slices. Meanwhile, it is challenging to learn the spatiotemporal correlation knowledge among traffic locations only by using neural networks. To address these issues, we propose a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Adjacent Graph Convolutional Network (DSTAGCN), which connects the latest time slice with each past time slice to construct the spatial-temporal graph. DSTAGCN can directly learn the global spatial dependency across time and simultaneously capture the spatial-temporal dependencies through graph convolution. Since fuzzy theory make it possible to represent uncertain relationships, a simplified fuzzy neural network that integrates fuzzy systems and neural networks is designed to help generating the graph adjacency matrix representing the dynamic adjacency correlations. Experiments on public datasets show that our method outperforms baselines with fast convergence.},

First, considering the fact that historical data carries intrinsic dynamic information about the spatial structure of road networks, we propose a new dynamic spatial-temporal aware graph based on a data-driven strategy to replace the pre-defined static graph usually used in traditional graph convolution. Second, we design a novel graph neural network architecture, which can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale gated convolution.

MASTGCN consists of several independent spatial-temporal blocks and a fully-connected layer. More specifically, each block consists of two major parts: 1) Two gate-fused attention mechanisms to model spatio-temporal relationships in traffic data; 2) The spatial-temporal convolution that applies graph convolutions and customary commonplace convolutions to describe spatial and temporal features simultaneously.

	abstract = {Accurate traffic forecasting enables efficient traffic management. However, traffic prediction is a challenging task, due to the fact that the traffic system itself is composed of complex interactions of multiple agents (e.g. randomly mixed vehicles with different mechanical characteristics, drivers with diverse driving habits, and road network with unique spatial-temporal correlation attributes among various nodes). To model these interactions, existing methods usually use a given static spatial adjacency graph to represent spatial-temporal dependencies. As a result, they can hardly capture the dynamic spatial-temporal relationships in the traffic network. This paper proposes a new Multi-Head self-Attention based Spatial-Temporal Information Graph Convolutional Networks (MH-ASTIGCN) for traffic flow forecasting where dynamic dependencies between traffic nodes are modelled for predicting the traffic evolution. Firstly, a data-driven strategy for generating temporal information graphs is proposed to amend the spatial correlation that cannot be fully captured by static spatial adjacency graphs. Secondly, we design a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism in our MH-ASTIGCN, considering the similarity of the traffic patterns between nodes in a road network as a priori, which can not only learn local spatial-temporal dependence, but also capture global deep spatial correlation and temporal features. Thirdly, we use different attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism to capture the complex multi-scale dependence among the neighborhoods of the spatial graph. Finally, we extend the graph convolutional neural network by integrating our improved attention mechanism to predict traffic flow. Experiments on several real-world data sets show that our proposed method outperforms several recent baseline methods, especially in long-term prediction.  We will release our code at https://github.com/SYLan2019/MH-ASTIGCN.},

Most methods chose the recent segment from historical data as input to predict the future traffic flow; however, this would lead to the loss of the inherent characteristic information of the metro passenger flow’s daily morning and evening peak. Therefore, this study aggregates the recent-term and long-term information and use a long-term Gated Convolutional Neural Network (Gated CNN) to extract the temporal feature from the complex historical data. On the other hand, typical models did not consider the different spatial dependencies between different metro stations; this work proposes various adjacent relationships to characterize the degree of association between nodes. In order to extract spatial and temporal features at the same time, the historical data of recent-term and long-term is merged together to extract spatial features through a multi-graph neural network module. By combining Gated CNN and multi-graph module, we propose a multi-time multi-graph neural network named MTMGNN for metro passenger flow prediction.

While traditional solutions face the dilemma from the trade-off between algorithm complexity and computational efficiency, our Ising-based method breaks away from the trade-off leveraging the Ising model's strong expressivity and the Ising machine's strong computation power. In particular, Ising-Traffic formulates traffic prediction under uncertainty into two Ising models: Reconstruct-Ising and Predict-Ising. Reconstruct-Ising is mapped onto modern Ising machines and handles uncertainty in traffic accurately with negligible latency and energy consumption, while Predict-Ising is mapped onto traditional processors and predicts future congestion precisely with only at most 1.8\% computational demands of existing solutions. Our evaluation shows Ising-Traffic delivers on average 98X speedups and 5\% accuracy improvement over SOTA.},

Accurate ride-hailing demand forecasting can guide vehicle dispatching, improve vehicle utilization, reduce the wait-time, and mitigate traffic congestion. This task is challenging due to the complicated spatiotemporal dependencies among regions. Existing approaches mainly focus on modeling the Euclidean correlations among spatially adjacent regions while we observe that non-Euclidean pair-wise correlations among possibly distant regions are also critical for accurate forecasting. In this paper, we propose the spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network (ST-MGCN), a novel deep learning model for ride-hailing demand forecasting. We first encode the non-Euclidean pair-wise correlations among regions into multiple graphs and then explicitly model these correlations using multi-graph convolution. To utilize the global contextual information in modeling the temporal correlation, we further propose contextual gated recurrent neural network which augments recurrent neural network with a contextual-aware gating mechanism to re-weights different historical observations. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world large scale ride-hailing demand datasets and observe consistent improvement of more than 10\% over stateof-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting constitutes a task of great importance in intelligent transport systems. Owing to the non-Euclidean structure of traffic data, the complicated spatial correlations, and the dynamic temporal dependencies, it is challenging to predict traffic accurately. Despite the fact that few prior studies have considered the interconnections between multiple traffic nodes at the same timestep, the majority of studies fail to capture the dependencies among multiple nodes at different timesteps. Furthermore, most existing work generates shallow graphs based solely on the distance between traffic nodes, which limits their representation competence and declines their power in capturing complex correlations. In particular, inspired by the recent breakthroughs in the generative adversarial network (GAN) and the power of the graph convolution network (GCN) in handling non-Euclidean data, this paper puts forward an adversarial multi-graph convolutional neural network model, named TFGAN, to address the abovementioned problems. We integrate the unsupervised model elasticity with the supervision provided by supervised training to help the GAN generator model generates accurate traffic predictions. To improve the representation and model the implicit correlations effectively, multiple GCNs are constructed within the generator based on various perspectives, such as similarity, correlation, and spatial distance. Meanwhile, GRU and self-attention are applied after each graph to capture the dynamic temporal dependencies across nodes. The comprehensive experiments on three different traffic variables (traffic flow, speed, and travel time) using six real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TFGAN outperforms the related state-of-the-art models and achieves significant results.},

	abstract = {The complex spatial-temporal correlations in transportation networks make the traffic forecasting problem challenging. Since transportation system inherently possesses graph structures, many research efforts have been put with graph neural networks. Recently, constructing adaptive graphs to the data has shown promising results over the models relying on a single static graph structure. However, the graph adaptations are applied during the training phases and do not reflect the data used during the testing phases. Such shortcomings can be problematic especially in traffic forecasting since the traffic data often suffer from unexpected changes and irregularities in the time series. In this study, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework called Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN). PGCN constructs a set of graphs by progressively adapting to online input data during the training and testing phases. Specifically, we implemented the model to construct progressive adjacency matrices by learning trend similarities among graph nodes. Then, the model is combined with the dilated causal convolution and gated activation unit to extract temporal features. With residual and skip connections, PGCN performs the traffic prediction. When applied to seven real-world traffic datasets of diverse geometric nature, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance with consistency in all datasets. We conclude that the ability of PGCN to progressively adapt to input data enables the model to generalize in different study sites with robustness.},

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting is a very challenging task due to the complicated and dynamic spatial–temporal correlations between traffic nodes. Most existing methods measure the spatial correlations by defining physical or virtual graphs with distance or similarity measurement, which is constructed with stable edge connections by some prior knowledge. However, the use of such graphs with stable edge connections limits the variations of spatial correlations between traffic nodes at different times, which can not capture the hidden dynamic patterns of traffic graphs. This paper proposes a Time-Variant Graph Convolutional Network (TVGCN) to overcome this limitation. Architecturally, a time-variant spatial convolutional module (TV-SCM) is developed on two graphs without any prior knowledge. One graph is learned to capture the stable spatial correlations of the traffic graph, while the other graph is evolved to model dynamic spatial correlations at different times. Such two graphs are combined hierarchically together under the framework of graph convolutional network (GCN). Moreover, a gated multi-scale temporal convolutional module (GMS-TCM) is designed to extract long-range temporal dependencies within traffic nodes, which are further supplied to the TV-SCM to mutually explore the spatial correlations between traffic nodes. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world traffic datasets indicate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.},

	abstract = {The prediction of crowd flows is an important urban computing issue whose purpose is to predict the future number of incoming and outgoing people in regions. Measuring the complicated spatial–temporal dependencies with external factors, such as weather conditions and surrounding point-of-interest (POI) distribution is the most difficult aspect of predicting crowd flows movement. To overcome the above issue, this paper advises a unified dynamic deep spatio-temporal neural network model based on convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory, termed as (DHSTNet) to simultaneously predict crowd flows in every region of a city. The DHSTNet model is made up of four separate components: a recent, daily, weekly, and an external branch component. Our proposed approach simultaneously assigns various weights to different branches and integrates the four properties’ outputs to generate final predictions. Moreover, to verify the generalization and scalability of the proposed model, we apply a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with the previously published model, termed as GCN-DHSTNet; to capture the spatial patterns and short-term temporal features; and to illustrate its exceptional accomplishment in predicting the traffic crowd flows. The GCN-DHSTNet model not only depicts the spatio-temporal dependencies but also reveals the influence of different time granularity, which are recent, daily, weekly periodicity and external properties, respectively. Finally, a fully connected neural network is utilized to fuse the spatio-temporal features and external properties together. Using two different real-world traffic datasets, our evaluation suggests that the proposed GCN-DHSTNet method is approximately 7.9\%–27.2\% and 11.2\%–11.9\% better than the AAtt-DHSTNet method in terms of RMSE and MAPE metrics, respectively. Furthermore, AAtt-DHSTNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting is of great importance to transportation management and public safety, and very challenging due to the complicated spatial-temporal dependency and essential uncertainty brought about by the road network and traffic conditions. Latest studies mainly focus on modeling the spatial dependency by utilizing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) throughout a fixed weighted graph. However, edges, i.e., the correlations between pair-wise nodes, are much more complicated and interact with each other. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Range Attentive Bicomponent GCN (MRA-BGCN), a novel deep learning model for traffic forecasting. We first build the node-wise graph according to the road network distance and the edge-wise graph according to various edge interaction patterns. Then, we implement the interactions of both nodes and edges using bicomponent graph convolution. The multi-range attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate information in different neighborhood ranges and automatically learn the importance of different ranges. Extensive experiments on two real-world road network traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, show that our MRA-BGCN achieves the state-of-the-art results.},

However, the intricate spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data present significant challenges for prediction accuracy. Existing methods often rely on predefined adjacency matrices to capture Spatio-temporal dependencies, which may not adapt well to the dynamic nature of road traffic. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Spatio-temporal Fusion Graph Recurrent Network (MSTFGRN). This innovative approach introduces a data-driven method for generating a weighted adjacency matrix, effectively capturing real-time spatial dependencies that are not adequately captured by predefined matrices. The MSTFGRN also incorporates a novel two-way Spatio-temporal fusion operation to learn hidden dependencies between parallel Spatio-temporal relations at different time points. Additionally, a global attention mechanism is integrated into the Spatio-temporal fusion module, enabling the simultaneous capture of global Spatio-temporal dependencies. Through extensive trials on publicly available highway traffic datasets, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to alternative baselines.},

These two algorithms can be used as a “pretraining”algorithm for a later supervised sequence learning algorithm. In other words, theparameters obtained from the pretraining step can then be used as a starting pointfor other supervised training models. In our experiments, we find that long shortterm memory recurrent networks after pretrained with the two approaches becomemore stable to train and generalize better.

Traffic speed is affected by temporal features, spatial features, and various environmental features. The prediction of traffic speed considering the above features is a big challenge. This study proposed a multi-step prediction model named embedding graph convolutional long short-term memory network (EGC-LSTM) for urban road network traffic speed prediction which can deal with spatial–temporal correlation and auxiliary features at the same time. Firstly, a graph convolutional network (GCN) for capturing directed graph properties is proposed. Based on the GCN, the LSTM and sequence to sequence model are further applied to realise multi-step prediction considering the spatial–temporal correlation of the traffic network. To improve the performance of the model and obtain the importance of each step in the historical data, the attention mechanism is introduced. Then, one-hot encoding is applied to the category-type auxiliary features. Considering that the dimension becomes larger after the features are one-hot encoded, the dimensions are reduced using embedding. The experiment results prove that the proposed model's performance is better than other models, and the model is interpreted in detail.},

	abstract = {In an intelligent transportation system, the key problem of traffic forecasting is how to extract periodic temporal dependencies and complex spatial correlations. Current state-of-the-art methods for predicting traffic flow are based on graph architectures and sequence learning models, but they do not fully exploit dynamic spatial-temporal information in the traffic system. Specifically, the temporal dependencies in the short-range are diluted by recurrent neural networks. Moreover, local spatial information is also ignored by existing sequence models, because their convolution operation uses global average pooling. Besides, accidents may occur during object transition, which will cause congestion in the real world and further decrease prediction accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose Spatial-Temporal Conv-sequence Learning (STCL), where a focused temporal block uses unidirectional convolution to capture short-term periodic temporal dependencies effectively, and a spatial-temporal fusion module is responsible for extracting dependencies of interactions and decreasing the feature dimensions. Moreover, as the accidents features have an impact on local traffic congestion, we employ position encoding to detect anomalies in complex traffic situations. We have conducted a large number of experiments on real-world tasks and verified the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

A flow prediction model aims at forecasting the traffic flow of future time slices at certain regions by learning the historical traffic flow data and environmental information. However, due to the complicated traffic network topology and the dynamicity of traffic patterns in the real world, it is difficult to capture the multi-level spatial dependencies (e.g. global and local impacts to the traffic) and temporal dependencies (e.g. long-term and short-term impacts to the traffic). In this paper, we propose a Multi-step Coupled Graph Convolution Neural network (MCGCN) with temporal attention to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies of different levels in a traffic network, simultaneously, to predict traffic flow. First, a Multi-step Coupled Graph Convolution module (MCGC) is designed to learn the representation of a traffic network by coupling learning the relationship matrices, to capture the different levels’ information of a traffic network. Then, the traffic network information extracted by MCGC is fed into a Multi-step Coupled Graph Gated Recurrent Unit (MCGRU) module to realize the fusion of traffic network information and temporal features. Finally, a Multi-step Coupled Graph Attention mechanism (MCGCAtt) is used to extract the temporal information of historical time steps to predict the future traffic flow.

Despite years of studies, accurate traffic prediction still faces the following challenges, including modeling the dynamics of trafﬁc data along both temporal and spatial dimensions, and capturing the periodicity and the spatial heterogeneity of trafﬁc data, and the problem is more difficult for long-term forecast. In this paper, we propose an Attention based Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ASTGNN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, in the temporal dimension, we design a novel self-attention mechanism that is capable of utilizing the local context, which is specialized for numerical sequence representation transformation. It enables our prediction model to capture the temporal dynamics of traffic data and to enjoy global receptive ﬁelds that is beneficial for long-term forecast. In the spatial dimension, we develop a dynamic graph convolution module, employing self-attention to capture the spatial correlations in a dynamic manner. Furthermore, we explicitly model the periodicity and capture the spatial heterogeneity through embedding modules. Experiments on five real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that ASTGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Deep networks often suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients due to inefficient signal propagation, leading to long training times or convergence difficulties. Various architecture designs, sophisticated residual-style networks, and initialization schemes have been shown to improve deep signal propagation. Recently, Pennington et al. [2017] used free probability theory to show that dynamical isometry plays an integral role in efficient deep learning. We show that the simplest architecture change of gating each residual connection using a single zero-initialized parameter satisfies initial dynamical isometry and outperforms more complex approaches. Although much simpler than its predecessors, this gate enables training thousands of fully connected layers with fast convergence and better test performance for ResNets trained on an image recognition task. We apply this technique to language modeling and find that we can easily train 120-layer Transformers. When applied to 12 layer Transformers, it converges 56\% faster.},

	abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.},

However, most of the existing methods focused on univariate prediction and rarely take into account the potential spatial dependencies between multiple variables. Multivariate time series forecasting can be naturally viewed from graph perspective, where each variable from multivariate time series can be viewed as a node in the graph, and they are interlinked through hidden dependencies. Therefore, a novel graph neural network model based on multi-scale temporal feature extraction and attention mechanism is proposed for multivariate time series prediction. Specifically, empirical modal decomposition is used to extract the time-domain features of multivariate time series at different time scales to form the node features of the graph. Meanwhile, the multi-head attention mechanism is applied to construct potential associations between nodes and enhance the rationality of relationships in the graph. Furthermore, the graph convolutional neural network is used to generate node embeddings that contain rich spatial relationships. Finally, the temporal convolutional network establishes temporal relationships for the node embedding to achieve multivariate time series prediction. The real data from the financial, traffic and medical fields confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {With the development of big data, large-scale traffic flow forecasting which is a part of smart transportation has become an increasingly important research direction. Accurate and real-time traffic flow prediction is the key and difficult part of the traffic. The complex spatial topological structure and dynamic traffic flow information in urban roads constitute a changeable spatial correlation, and the daily traffic flow cycle and weekly traffic flow cycle constitute a complex time correlation. For the current mainstream model, there are two main limitations: 1. Most of the existing models only focus on time correlation and ignore spatial correlation. 2. Even if the spatial correlation is concerned, the topological relationship between spaces is not fully considered. This paper proposes a new traffic-flow prediction model, which named Principal Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (PST-GCN) model, which uses a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Graph Convolution Network (GCN), and Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM). Specifically, PCA is used to reduce the dimension of data, GCN is used to learn the network topology of urban roads, LSTM is used to capture the time correlation of traffic flow. By comparing the results of different models, the proposed model is better than the current mainstream models.},

Instead, we argue that the improvement can be achieved by using traffic-related facts or laws, which is termed exogenous knowledge. To this end, we propose a knowledge-driven memory system that can be seamlessly integrated into GCN-based traffic forecasting models. Specifically, the memory system includes three components: access interface, memory module, and feedback interface. The access interface based on the attention mechanism and the feedback interface based on the gate mechanism are used to guide the model to extract useful patterns and integrate these patterns into the model to enhance spatiotemporal representation respectively. The memory module is used to learn specific knowledge-based patterns, and this is achieved by constraining the learning process with unsupervised loss functions formulated inspired by exogenous knowledge. We construct three kinds of memory modules driven by different exogenous knowledge: the long-term trend memory to learn periodic patterns, the hierarchical effect memory to capture coarse-grained region patterns, and the representative pattern memory to extract representative patterns. Experiments combined with multiple existing models demonstrate the effectiveness of the memory system.},

	abstract = {Urban traffic flow prediction is a crucial service in intelligent transportation systems. It is very challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies and inherent uncertainty caused by dynamic urban traffic conditions. Recent work has focused on designing complex Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architectures to capture spatial dependencies among segment-level traffic status and achieves state-of-the-art performance. But these GCN based methods has two shortcomings. One on hand, they ignore cross-region movement which reflects traffic flow transfer patterns at the regional level. On the other hand, they fail to capture the long-term temporal dependencies of traffic flows due to its non-linearity and dynamics. In order to address the above-mentioned deficiencies, we propose a novel Region-aware Graph Convolution Networks (RGCN) for traffic forecasting. Specially, a DTW-based pooling layer is introduced to capture the cross-regional spatial correlation, based on which a traffic region graph is constructed from the original traffic network and is employed to model cross-region traffic flow. Besides, a transformer-based temporal module is proposed to model long-term and dynamic temporal dependencies across multiple time steps. The proposed model is evaluated on two public traffic network datasets and the experimental results show that RGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

Existing studies usually employ pre-defined spatial graph or learned fixed adjacency graph and design models to capture spatial and temporal features. However, pre-defined or fixed graph can not accurately model the complex hidden structure. Moreover, few solutions are satisfied with both long and short-term prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-stage graph convolution network based on graph learning (DSGCN) to address these challenges. To equip the graph convolution network with a flexible and practical graph structure, DSGCN designs a graph learning module to model the varying relations among nodes in the road network. In particular, we first provide a hierarchical graph structure cooperated with the dilated convolution to capture the temporal dependencies. Second, a dual-stage graph convolution layer is proposed to capture the complex spatial dependencies. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DSGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, especially for long-term traffic prediction.},

	abstract = {In intelligent transportation systems, accurate long-term traffic forecasting is informative for administrators and travelers to make wise decisions in advance. Recently proposed spatial-temporal forecasting models perform well for short-term traffic forecasting, but two challenges hinder their applications for long-term forecasting in practice. Firstly, existing traffic forecasting models do not have satisfactory scalability on effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., as the prediction time spans extend, existing models either cannot capture the long-term spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data or equip global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic computational complexity. Secondly, the dilemma between the models’ strong appetite for high-quality training data and their generalization ability is also a challenge we have to face. Thus how to improve data utilization efficiency deserves thoughtful thinking. Aiming at solving the long-term traffic forecasting problem and facilitating the deployment of traffic forecasting models in practice, this paper proposes an efficient and effective Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Bottleneck Attentive Network (SSTBAN). Specifically, SSTBAN follows a multi-task framework by incorporating a self-supervised learner to produce robust latent representations for historical traffic data, so as to improve its generalization performance and robustness for forecasting. Besides, we design a spatial-temporal bottleneck attention mechanism, reducing the computational complexity meanwhile encoding global spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on real-world long-term traffic forecasting tasks, including traffic speed forecasting and traffic flow forecasting under nine scenarios, demonstrate that SSTBAN not only achieves the overall best performance but also has good computation efficiency and data utilization efficiency.},

	abstract = {Among various region embedding methods, graph-based region relation learning models stand out, owing to their strong structure representation ability for encoding spatial correlations with graph neural networks. Despite their effectiveness, several key challenges have not been well addressed in existing methods: i) Data noise and missing are ubiquitous in many spatio-temporal scenarios due to a variety of factors. ii) Input spatio-temporal data (e.g., mobility traces) usually exhibits distribution heterogeneity across space and time. In such cases, current methods are vulnerable to the quality of the generated region graphs, which may lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges by exploring the Automated Spatio-Temporal graph contrastive learning paradigm (AutoST) over the heterogeneous region graph generated from multi-view data sources. Our AutoST framework is built upon a heterogeneous graph neural architecture to capture the multi-view region dependencies with respect to POI semantics, mobility flow patterns and geographical positions. To improve the robustness of our GNN encoder against data noise and distribution issues, we design an automated spatio-temporal augmentation scheme with a parameterized contrastive view generator. AutoST can adapt to the spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph with multi-view semantics well preserved. Extensive experiments for three downstream spatio-temporal mining tasks on several real-world datasets demonstrate the significant performance gain achieved by our AutoST over a variety of baselines.

In this work, we think that pre-defined graph or general learning method is difficult due to their irregular structure. Hence, we present CATN, an end-to-end model of Cross Attentive Tree-aware Network to jointly capture the inter-series correlation and intra-series temporal pattern. We first construct a tree structure to learn hierarchical and grouped correlation and design an embedding approach that can pass dynamic message to generalize implicit but interpretable cross features among multiple time series. Next in temporal aspect, we propose a multi-level dependency learning mechanism including global\&local learning and cross attention mechanism, which can combine long-range dependencies, short-range dependencies as well as cross dependencies at different time steps.

In this paper, we are therefore motivated to improve the canonical spatio-temporal network (ST-Net) from two perspectives: (1) design a heterogeneous mobility information network (HMIN) to explicitly represent intermodality in multimodal mobility; (2) propose a memory-augmented dynamic filter generator (MDFG) to generate sequence-specific parameters in an on-the-fly fashion for various scenarios.

	abstract = {High-performance traffic flow prediction model designing, a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, is a long-standing but still challenging task for industrial and academic communities. The lack of integration between physical principles and data-driven models is an important reason for limiting the development of this field. In the literature, physics-based methods can usually provide a clear interpretation of the dynamic process of traffic flow systems but are with limited accuracy, while data-driven methods, especially deep learning with black-box structures, can achieve improved performance but can not be fully trusted due to lack of a reasonable physical basis. To bridge the gap between purely data-driven and physics-driven approaches, we propose a physics-guided deep learning model named Spatio-Temporal Differential Equation Network (STDEN), which casts the physical mechanism of traffic flow dynamics into a deep neural network framework. Specifically, we assume the traffic flow on road networks is driven by a latent potential energy field (like water flows are driven by the gravity field), and model the spatio-temporal dynamic process of the potential energy field as a differential equation network. STDEN absorbs both the performance advantage of data-driven models and the interpretability of physics-based models, so is named a physics-guided prediction model. Experiments on three real-world traffic datasets in Beijing show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. A case study further verifies that STDEN can capture the mechanism of urban traffic and generate accurate predictions with physical meaning. The proposed framework of differential equation network modeling may also cast light on other similar applications.},

The primary goal of IoV is to provide a vehicular platform to enable better communication and Quality of Service (QoS) for vehicles, pedestrians, and roadside infrastructure in real-time, through the use of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Network (V2N), and Vehicle-to-Cloud (V2C) channels. However, the increasing number of vehicular services poses serious concerns and challenges to the researchers: real-time traffic forecasting, service placement, security, reliability, and routing. The primary focus of this work is concerned with the challenge of multi-regional forecasting of multi-class traffic. These traffic forecasting models enable pro-activeness in systems by providing real-time and accurate predictions. Also, they can explore traffic densities over spatial and temporal domains for various vehicle types. However, current literature cannot provide forecasts for multi-region and multi-class vehicles at the same time. This study aims at enabling a proactive platform which could make decisions based on the integrated Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based traffic forecasting model, i.e., Spatio-Temporal GNN (STGNN) based traffic forecasting model. The STGNN-based traffic forecasting model uses the GNN and GRU models to explore spatial and temporal features of varying vehicular multi-class traffic densities. In GNN, spatial data consisting of multi-class traffic densities are utilized for the feature extraction that results in graph embeddings. In the GRU, these graph embeddings are utilized for temporal feature extraction. This approach enables the forecasting of multi-class vehicular traffic densities and the pro-activeness of an IoV platform. In addition, the performance results show that an intelligent platform can be built upon the proposed traffic forecasting model that is capable of inspecting complex and nonlinear traffic accurately.},

	abstract = {Predicting traffic conditions is tremendously challenging since every road is highly dependent on each other, both spatially and temporally. Recently, to capture this spatial and temporal dependency, specially designed architectures such as graph convolutional networks and temporal convolutional networks have been introduced. While there has been remarkable progress in traffic forecasting, we found that deep-learning-based traffic forecasting models still fail in certain patterns, mainly in event situations (e.g., rapid speed drops). Although it is commonly accepted that these failures are due to unpredictable noise, we found that these failures can be corrected by considering previous failures. Specifically, we observe autocorrelated errors in these failures, which indicates that some predictable information remains. In this study, to capture the correlation of errors, we introduce ResCAL, a residual estimation module for traffic forecasting, as a widely applicable add-on module to existing traffic forecasting models. Our ResCAL calibrates the prediction of the existing models in real time by estimating future errors using previous errors and graph signals. Extensive experiments on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY demonstrate that our ResCAL can correctly capture the correlation of errors and correct the failures of various traffic forecasting models in event situations.},

Many existing works design static neural network architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal correlations, which is hard to adapt to different datasets. Although recent neural architecture search approaches have addressed this problem, it still adopts a coarse-grained search with pre-defined and fixed components in the search space for spatio-temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture search framework, entitled AutoSTS, for automated spatio-temporal synchronous modeling in traffic prediction. To be specific, we design a graph neural network (GNN) based architecture search module to capture localized spatio-temporal correlations, where multiple graphs built from different perspectives are jointly utilized to find a better message passing way for mining such correlations. Further, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture search module to capture temporal dependencies with various ranges, where gated temporal convolutions with different kernel sizes and convolution types are designed in search space. Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that our model can achieve 4\%-10\% improvements compared with other methods.},

Existing works mostly model such spatial-temporal dependencies by considering spatial correlations and temporal correlations separately, or within a sliding temporal window, and fail to model the direct spatial-temporal correlations. Inspired by the recent success of transformers in the graph domain, in this paper, we propose to directly model the cross-spatial-temporal correlations on the adaptive spatial-temporal graph using local multi-head self-attentions. We then propose a novel Adaptive Graph Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network (ASTTN), which stacks multiple spatial-temporal attention layers to apply self-attention on the input graph, followed by linear layers for predictions.

In this paper, with the evidence via preliminary analysis, we point out the importance of considering individual dependencies between two speeds from all possible points in space and time for accurate traffic speed prediction. Then, we propose an Individual Spatio-Temporal graph (IST-graph) that represents the Individual Spatio-Temporal dependencies (IST-dependencies) very effectively and a Spatio-Temporal Graph ATtention network (ST-GAT), a novel model to predict the future traffic speeds based on the IST-graph and the attention mechanism. The results from our extensive evaluation with five real-world datasets demonstrate (1) the effectiveness of the IST-graph in modeling traffic speed data, (2) the superiority of ST-GAT over 5 state-of-the-art models (i.e., 2-33\% gains) in prediction accuracy, and (3) the robustness of our ST-GAT even in abnormal traffic situations.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that concurrently extracting spatial and temporal information is a better way to model spatial-temporal data. However, in these studies, the receptive field has been fixed to construct the carrier of concurrent extraction, resulting in the lack of flexibility in selecting receptive fields, and the loss of scalability for capturing long-range temporal dependencies. Furthermore, these studies will result in static weights that are insufficient to describe the complex spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose the Concurrent Spatial-Temporal Transformer (CSTT), which ensures the denseness of the carrier of concurrent extraction, so that messages under different receptive fields can be passed more efficiently, thus making the selection of receptive field more flexible. Therefore, the scalability of capturing long-range temporal dependencies can also be promised. Additionally, a unified self-attention mechanism will be applied on the carrier of concurrent extraction to capture spatial and temporal information, so that the dependencies between both dimensions under different contextual information can be preserved. On these bases, we design an iterative strategy to further tackle long sequences. Experiments on four traffic real-world datasets illustrate that our algorithm can achieve significant improvement on the classical spatial-temporal modeling task.},

	abstract = {Traffic prediction is a fundamental operation in real-time traffic analysis. A precise prediction of traffic condition can benefit both road users and traffic management agencies. However, since road traffic is decided by multiple static and dynamic factors, traffic prediction is still a challenging task. As the core indicator of traffic condition, many works focus on traffic speed prediction using time-series forecasting approaches. Although current methods take into account the static road topology while modelling, they fail to consider (1) the semantic closeness between road components and (2) congestion caused by upstream/downstream traffic propagation. In this paper, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Network using JS-Graph, which considers both static road features and dynamic traffic flows when forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a data-driven ‘JS-Graph’ method that describes the semantic similarity between road nodes. It models the complex spatial correlations that cannot be captured by the traditional spatial adjacency graph. Secondly, we design a dynamic graph attention network that considers the traffic dynamics that happened in previous time slices when predicting the current one to capture the congestion propagation phenomena. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that our proposed method is significantly better than baselines.},

The problem is challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal correlations and nonlinearities of traffic flows. However, existing methods based on the graph neural networks cannot efficiently extract the dynamic and long-range spatial correlations, thus producing unsatisfactory prediction results. In this paper, we propose an AdaBoost Spatio-temporal Network (Ada-STNet). Similar to AdaBoost, Ada-STNet stacks several base neural networks as "layers" which capture spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Each layer learns an adaptive adjacency matrix from weights and embedding of nodes. The adjacency matrix is layer-wise adjusted to extract information from distant neighbors and adapt to dynamic correlations. Experiments are conducted on three real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating that the Ada-STNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Traffic time series forecasting is challenging due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics-time series from different locations often have distinct patterns; and for the same time series, patterns may vary across time, where, for example, there exist certain periods across a day showing stronger temporal correlations. Although recent forecasting models, in particular deep learning based models, show promising results, they suf-fer from being spatio-temporal agnostic. Such spatio-temporal agnostic models employ a shared parameter space irrespective of the time series locations and the time periods and they assume that the temporal patterns are similar across locations and do not evolve across time, which may not always hold, thus leading to sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a framework that aims at turning spatio-temporal agnostic models to spatio-temporal aware models. To do so, we encode time series from different locations into stochastic variables, from which we generate location-specific and time-varying model parameters to better capture the spatio-temporal dynamics. We show how to integrate the framework with canonical attentions to enable spatio-temporal aware attentions. Next, to compensate for the additional overhead introduced by the spatio-temporal aware model parameter generation process, we propose a novel window attention scheme, which helps reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear, making spatio-temporal aware attentions also have competitive efficiency. We show strong empirical evidence on four traffic time series datasets, where the proposed spatio-temporal aware attentions outperform state-of-the-art methods in term of accuracy and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Docked bike systems have been widely deployed in many cities around the world. To the service provider, predicting the demand and supply of bikes at any station is crucial to offering the best service quality. The docked bike prediction problem is highly challenging because of the complicated joint spatial-temporal (ST) dependency as bikes are picked up and dropped off, the so-called “flows”, between stations. Prior works often considered the spatial and temporal dependencies separately using sequential network models, and based on locality assumptions. Without sufficiently capturing the joint spatial and temporal features, these approaches are not optimal for attaining the best prediction accuracy. We propose STGNN-DJD, a novel data-driven Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network to solve the bike demand and supply prediction problem by unifiedly embedding the Dynamic and Joint ST Dependency in two novel ST graphs. Given station locations and historical rental data on bike flow over the past time slots 0 to t-1, we seek to predict online the bike demand and supply at any station at time t. To extract joint spatial-temporal dependency, STGNN-DJD employs a graph generator to construct, at the beginning of time t, two graphs that embed the flow relationships between stations at various time slots (flow-convoluted graph) and dynamic demand-supply pattern correlation between stations (pattern correlation graph), respectively. Given the two spatial-temporal graphs, STGNN-DJD subsequently employs a graph neural network with novel flow-based and attention-based aggregators to generate embedding of each station for docked bike prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments on two large bike-sharing datasets. Our re-sults confirm the effectiveness of STGNN-DJD as compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, with significant improvement on RMSE and MAE (by 20\%-50\%). We also provide a case study on dynamic dependencies between stations and demonstrate that the locality assumption does not always hold for a docked bike system.},

	abstract = {Conditional traffic estimation is a vital problem in urban plan deployment, which can help evaluate urban construction plans and improve transportation efficiency. Conventional methods for conditional traffic estimation usually focus on supervised settings, which require a large amount of labeled training data. However, in many urban planning applications, the large amount of traffic data in a new city can be hard or impossible to acquire. To tackle the conditional traffic estimation problem in data scarcity situations, we formulate the problem as a spatial transfer generative learning problem. Compared to prior spatial transfer learning frameworks with only single source city, we propose to extracts knowledge from multiple source cities to improve the estimation accuracy and transfer stability, which is a technically more challenging task. As a solution, we propose a new cross-city conditional traffic estimation method — Spatially-Transferable Generative Adversarial Networks (STrans-GAN) with novel pre-training and fine-tuning algorithms. STransGAN preserves diverse traffic patterns from multiple source cities through traffic clustering, and incorporates meta-learning idea into the pre-training process to learn a well-generalized model. During fine-tuning, we propose to add a cluster matching regularizer to realize the flexible adaptation in different scenarios. Through extensive experiments on multiple-city datasets, the effectiveness of STrans-GAN is proved.},

However, these works still fall short due to: 1) deep GNNs have the over-smoothing problem that hinders the handling of higher-order spatial correlations; 2) TNNs have difficulty in extracting the temporal dependencies with different localities. To this end, this paper proposes Higher-Order Masked Graph Neural Networks (HOMGNNs) to model and predict the traffic flow data. Concretely, we design the spatial graph learning layer to adaptively characterize the dependency correlations of different orders, and the higher-order GNN (HOGNN) is further proposed to deal with these correlations. Furthermore, we define and construct a temporal graph to represent the temporal dynamics in traffic data. The masked GNN (MGNN) is further proposed to extract these dynamics based on the temporal graph. To validate the superiority of the proposed HOMGNNs, we conduct extensive experiments on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our method compared with 11 state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {As a promising learning paradigm for addressing the data scarcity and distribution mismatch issues, cross-domain prediction aims to leverage the transferable knowledge from the source domain to solve the learning problems in the target domain. Indeed, many urban computing tasks, such as cross- city/mode traffic flow prediction, have to face the severe data scarcity problem due to the heterogeneity in different data sources as well as the imbalanced development among cities. To this end, in this paper, we propose a cross-domain learning framework, namely CCMHC, which exploits Hierarchical Correlation between domains for Cross-City cross-Mode traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we first measure the correlation among inter-city traffic flows by exploring the similarity of region functions and road-networks. In this step, we filter out the regions with lower transfer ability from the source city to the target city. Then, we calculate the temporal correlations of traffic flows across different modes to select a source region that is highly related to the target region in a dynamic way. Moreover, a cross-domain urban flow prediction method is devised by transferring shared knowledge from the source city to the target city. Finally, experimental results on real-world data demonstrate the superiority of CCMHC over the state-of-the-art transfer learning methods. In addition, the generalization ability of the CCMHC framework on different neural network-based models is also validated.},

There are three expectations for a good OD traffic predictor: 1) higher accuracy; 2) longer horizon; 3) better applicability. This paper proposes a Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Network (HSTN) model to predict OD traffic. The model emphasizes capturing more comprehensive spatial correlations among the sources of the traffic flows and temporal correlations between historical values and future prediction. HSTN is designed to have a Hybrid Spatial Module (HSM) and a Hybrid Temporal Module (HTM). HSM consists of three units to learn three types of spatial relationships and HTM consists of two units to quantity the influence of the input sequence on the target result. We evaluate HSTN on three real-world datasets of different travel modes in different cities. Results show that the proposed HSTN outperforms existing methods in both short-term and long-term predictions in all datasets.},

However, the input representations, models, and datasets for LTCFP are currently limited. To this end, we propose Fourier Isovists, a novel input representation based on egocentric visibility, which consistently improves all existing models. We also propose GeoInteractNet (GINet), which couples the layers between a multiscale attention network (M-SCAN) and a convolutional encoder-decoder network (CED). M-SCAN approximates a super-resolution map of where humans are likely to interact on the way to their goals and produces multi-scale attention maps. The CED then uses these maps in either its encoder’s inputs or its decoder’s attention gates, which allows GINet to produce super-resolution predictions with substantially higher accuracy than existing models even with Fourier Isovists. In order to evaluate the scalability of models to large and complex environments, which the only existing LTCFP dataset is unsuitable for, a new synthetic crowd dataset with both real and synthetic environments has been generated. In its nascent state, LTCFP has much to gain from our key contributions. The Supplementary Materials, dataset, and code are available at sssohn.github.io/GeoInteractNet.},

	abstract = {Many real-world ubiquitous applications, such as parking recommendations and air pollution monitoring, benefit significantly from accurate long-term spatio-temporal forecasting (LSTF). LSTF makes use of long-term dependency between spatial and temporal domains, contextual information, and inherent pattern in the data. Recent studies have revealed the potential of multi-graph neural networks (MGNNs) to improve prediction performance. However, existing MGNN methods cannot be directly applied to LSTF due to several issues: the low level of generality, insufficient use of contextual information, and the imbalanced graph fusion approach. To address these issues, we construct new graph models to represent the contextual information of each node and the long-term spatio-temporal data dependency structure. To fuse the information across multiple graphs, we propose a new dynamic multi-graph fusion module to characterize the correlations of nodes within a graph and the nodes across graphs via the spatial attention and graph attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we introduce a trainable weight tensor to indicate the importance of each node in different graphs. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly improve the performance of existing graph neural network models in LSTF prediction tasks.},

	abstract = {Urban flow prediction is a fundamental task to build smart cities, where neural networks have become the most popular method. However, the deep learning methods typically rely on massive training data that are probably inaccessible in real world. In light of this, the community calls for knowledge transfer. However, when adapting transfer learning for cross-city prediction tasks, existing studies are built on static knowledge transfer, ignoring the fact inter-city correlations change dynamically across time. The dynamic correlations make urban feature transfer challenging. This paper proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Adaptation Network (STAN) to perform urban flow prediction for data-scarce cities via the spatio-temporal knowledge transferred from data-rich cities. STAN encompasses three modules: i) spatial adversarial adaptation module that adopts an adversarial manner to capture the transferable spatial features; ii) temporal attentive adaptation module to attend to critical dynamics for temporal feature transfer; iii) prediction module that aims to learn task-driven transferable knowledge. Extensive experiments on five real datasets show STAN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Multivariate time-series forecasting is a critical task for many applications, and graph time-series network is widely studied due to its capability to capture the spatial-temporal correlation simultaneously. However, most existing works focus more on learning with the explicit prior graph structure, while ignoring potential information from the implicit graph structure, yielding incomplete structure modeling. Some recent works attempt to learn the intrinsic or implicit graph structure directly while lacking a way to combine explicit prior structure with implicit structure together. In this paper, we propose Regularized Graph Structure Learning (RGSL) model to incorporate both explicit prior structure and implicit structure together, and learn the forecasting deep networks along with the graph structure. RGSL consists of two innovative modules. First, we derive an implicit dense similarity matrix through node embedding, and learn the sparse graph structure using the Regularized Graph Generation (RGG) based on the Gumbel Softmax trick. Second, we propose a Laplacian Matrix Mixed-up Module (LM3) to fuse the explicit graph and implicit graph together. We conduct experiments on three real-word datasets. Results show that the proposed RGSL model outperforms existing graph forecasting algorithms with a notable margin, while learning meaningful graph structure simultaneously.

Existing studies usually manually construct correlation graphs and design sophisticated models for learning spatial and temporal features to predict future trafﬁc states. However, manually constructed correlation graphs cannot accurately extract the complex patterns hidden in the trafﬁc data. In addition, it is challenging for the prediction model to ﬁt trafﬁc data due to its irregularly-shaped distribution. To solve the abovementioned problems, in this paper, we propose a novel learning-based method to learn a spatialtemporal correlation graph, which could make good use of the trafﬁc ﬂow data. Moreover, we propose First-Order Gradient Supervision (FOGS), a novel method for trafﬁc ﬂow forecasting. FOGS utilizes ﬁrst-order gradients, rather than speciﬁc ﬂows, to train prediction model, which effectively avoids the problem of ﬁtting irregularly-shaped distributions. Comprehensive numerical evaluations on four real-world datasets reveal that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance and signiﬁcantly outperform the benchmarks.},

This task is rather challenging due to the complicated and long-range spatial temporal dependencies in traffic network. Existing studies typically employ different deep neural networks to learn the spatial and temporal representations so as to capture the complex and dynamic dependencies. In this paper, we argue that it is insufficient to capture the long-range spatial dependencies from the implicit representations learned by temporal extracting modules. To address this problem, we propose Multi-Step Dependency Relation (MSDR), a brand new variant of recurrent neural network. Instead of only looking at the hidden state from only one latest time step, MSDR explicitly takes those of multiple historical time steps as the input of each time unit. We also develop two strategies to incur the spatial information into the dependency relation embedding between multiple historical time steps and the current one in MSDR. On the basis of it, we propose the Graph-based MSDR (GMSDR) framework to support general spatial temporal forecasting applications by seamlessly integrating graph-based neural networks with MSDR. We evaluate our proposed approach on several popular datasets. The results show that the proposed GMSDR framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an obvious margin.},

However, few studies tackled the uncertainty and sparsity issues in fine-grained O-D matrices. This presents a serious problem, because a vast number of zeros deviate from the Gaussian assumption underlying the deterministic deep learning models. To address this issue, we design a Spatial-Temporal Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Network (STZINB-GNN) to quantify the uncertainty of the sparse travel demand. It analyzes spatial and temporal correlations using diffusion and temporal convolution networks, which are then fused to parameterize the probabilistic distributions of travel demand. The STZINB-GNN is examined using two real-world datasets with various spatial and temporal resolutions. The results demonstrate the superiority of STZINB-GNN over benchmark models, especially under high spatial-temporal resolutions, because of its high accuracy, tight confidence intervals, and interpretable parameters. The sparsity parameter of the STZINB-GNN has physical interpretation for various transportation applications.},

Due to the high cost of data collection, some developing cities have few available data, which makes it infeasible to train a well-performed model. To address this challenge, cross-city knowledge transfer has shown its promise, where the model learned from data-sufficient cities is leveraged to benefit the learning process of data-scarce cities. However, the spatio-temporal graphs among different cities show irregular structures and varied features, which limits the feasibility of existing Few-Shot Learning (FSL) methods. Therefore, we propose a model-agnostic few-shot learning framework for spatio-temporal graph called ST-GFSL. Specifically, to enhance feature extraction by transferring cross-city knowledge, ST-GFSL proposes to generate non-shared parameters based on node-level meta knowledge. The nodes in target city transfer the knowledge via parameter matching, retrieving from similar spatio-temporal characteristics. Furthermore, we propose to reconstruct the graph structure during meta-learning. The graph reconstruction loss is defined to guide structure-aware learning, avoiding structure deviation among different datasets. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four traffic speed prediction benchmarks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of ST-GFSL compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

Existing methods, typically relying on graph neural networks (GNNs) and temporal learning modules based on recurrent neural networks, have achieved significant performance improvements. However, their representation capabilities and prediction results are limited when pre-defined graphs are unavailable. Unlike spatio-temporal GNNs focusing on designing complex architectures, we propose a novel adaptive graph construction strategy: Self-Paced Graph Contrastive Learning (SPGCL). It learns informative relations by maximizing the distinguishing margin between positive and negative neighbors and generates an optimal graph with a self-paced strategy. Specifically, the existing neighborhoods iteratively absorb more reliable nodes with the highest affinity scores as new neighbors to generate the next-round neighborhoods, and augmentations are applied to improve the transferability and robustness. As the adaptively self-paced graph approaches the optimized graph for prediction, the mutual information between nodes and the corresponding neighbors is maximized. Our work provides a new perspective of addressing spatio-temporal learning problems beyond information aggregation in Euclidean space and can be generalized to different tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two typical spatio-temporal learning tasks (traffic forecasting and land displacement prediction) demonstrate the superior performance of SPGCL against the state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {Deep learning models have been demonstrated powerful in modeling complex spatio-temporal data for traffic prediction. In practice, effective deep traffic prediction models rely on large-scale traffic data, which is not always available in real-world scenarios. To alleviate the data scarcity issue, a promising way is to use cross-city transfer learning methods to fine-tune well-trained models from source cities with abundant data. However, existing approaches overlook the divergence between source and target cities, and thus, the trained model from source cities may contain noise or even harmful source knowledge. To address the problem, we propose CrossTReS, a selective transfer learning framework for traffic prediction that adaptively re-weights source regions to assist target fine-tuning. As a general framework for fine-tuning-based cross-city transfer learning, CrossTReS consists of a feature network, a weighting network, and a prediction model. We train the feature network with node- and edge-level domain adaptation techniques to learn generalizable spatial features for both source and target cities. We further train the weighting network via source-target joint meta-learning such that source regions helpful to target fine-tuning are assigned high weights. Finally, the prediction model is selectively trained on the source city with the learned weights to initialize target fine-tuning. We evaluate CrossTReS using real-world taxi and bike data, where under the same settings, CrossTReS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 8\%. Moreover, the learned region weights offer interpretable visualization.},

	abstract = {With increasing population of modern cities, accurate estimation of regional passenger demands is critical to online taxicab services as such platforms aim at a reformation of taxicab scheduling for a more efficient order dispatching. Though great efforts have been made on passenger demand predictions, existing works still have the following shortcomings: i) they mostly performed based on uniform grid partition, which results in the imbalance of demand volumes among regions and even non-vehicle regions in such partition, ii) none of previous demand forecasting efforts have highlighted the important mutual influences between pick-ups and drop-offs, which are of great significance for taxicab scheduling. To this end, we first devise a multi-kernel based clustering to achieve a taxicab-behavior and geographic-aware sub-region partition, hence a more balanced and compact regional division is obtained. Subsequently, we emphasize the essential factors with regard to mutual transition quantification in taxicab predictions, then propose a Transfer-LSTM and an Origin-Destination-based transition matrix to respectively capture the drop-to-pick and pick-to-drop spatiotemporal transition patterns. Hence, a novel mutual-transition-aware co-prediction framework is devised by capturing complex spatiotemporal interactions between pick-ups and drop-offs. Extensive experiments on two real-world taxicab datasets demonstrate our co-prediction framework is superior to state-of-the-art methods, thus providing novel perspectives to urban human mobility understanding and transition-based taxicab scheduling.},

	abstract = {Urban flow prediction plays a crucial role in public transportation management and smart city construction. Although previous studies have achieved success in integrating spatial-temporal information to some extents, those models lack thoughtful consideration on global information and positional information in the temporal dimension, which can be summarized by three aspects: a) The models do not consider the relative position information of time axis, resulting in that the position features of flow maps are not effectively learned. b) They overlook the correlation among temporal dependencies of different scales, which lead to inaccurate global information representation. c) Those models only predict the flow map at the end of time sequence other than more flow maps before that, which results in neglecting parts of temporal features in the learning process. To solve the problems, we propose a novel model, Spatial-Temporal Global Semantic representation learning for urban flow Prediction (ST-GSP) in this paper. Specifically, for a), we design a semantic flow encoder that extracts relative positional information of time. Besides, the encoder captures the spatial dependencies and external factors of urban flow at each time interval. For b), we model the correlation among temporal dependencies of different scales simultaneously by using the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which can learn the global temporal dependencies. For c), inspired by the idea of self-supervised learning, we mask an urban flow map on the time sequence and predict it to pre-train a deep bidirectional learning model to catch the representation from its context. We conduct extensive experiments on two types of urban flows in Beijing and New York City to show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is powering a rapidly-increasing number of web applications. As a crucial part of 5G, edge computing facilitates edge artificial intelligence (AI) by ML model training and inference at the network edge on edge servers. Compared with centralized cloud AI, edge AI enables low-latency ML inference which is critical to many delay-sensitive web applications, e.g., web AR/VR, web gaming and Web-of-Things applications. Existing studies of edge AI focused on resource and performance optimization in training and inference, leveraging edge computing merely as a tool to accelerate training and inference processes. However, the unique ability of edge computing to process data with context awareness, a powerful feature for building the web-of-things for smart cities, has not been properly explored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Pyramid that unleashes the potential of edge AI by facilitating homogeneous and heterogeneous hierarchical ML inferences. We motivate and present Pyramid with traffic prediction as an illustrative example, and evaluate it through extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of Pyramid neural networks in hierarchical traffic prediction and weather analysis.},

	abstract = {Urban dockless e-scooter sharing (DES) has become a popular Web-of-Things (WoT) service and widely adopted globally. Despite its early commercial success, conventional mobility demand and supply prediction based on machine learning and subsequent redistribution may favor advantaged socio-economic communities and tourist regions, at the expense of reducing mobility accessibility and resource allocation for historically disadvantaged communities. To address this unfairness, we propose a socially-Equitable Interactive Graph information fusion-based mobility flow prediction system for Dockless E-scooter Sharing (EIGDES). By considering city regions as nodes connected by trips, EIGDES learns and captures the complex interactions across spatial and temporal graph features through a novel interactive graph information dissemination and fusion structure. We further design a novel model learning objective with metrics that capture both the mobility distributions and the socio-economic factors, ensuring spatial fairness in the communities’ resource accessibility and their experienced DES prediction accuracy. Through its integration with the optimization regularizer, EIGDES jointly learns the DES flow patterns and socio-economic factors, and returns socially-equitable flow predictions. Our in-depth experimental study upon more than 2,122,270 DES trips from three metropolitan cities in North America has demonstrated EIGDES’s effectiveness in accurate prediction of DES flow patterns with substantial reduction of mobility unfairness.},

	abstract = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been widely applied in transportation demand prediction due to its excellent ability to capture non-Euclidean spatial dependence among station-level or regional transportation demands. However, in most of the existing research, the graph convolution was implemented on a heuristically generated adjacency matrix, which could neither reflect the real spatial relationships of stations accurately, nor capture the multi-level spatial dependence of demands adaptively. To cope with the above problems, this paper provides a novel graph convolutional network for transportation demand prediction. Firstly, a novel graph convolution architecture is proposed, which has different adjacency matrices in different layers and all the adjacency matrices are self-learned during the training process. Secondly, a layer-wise coupling mechanism is provided, which associates the upper-level adjacency matrix with the lower-level one. It also reduces the scale of parameters in our model. Lastly, a unitary network is constructed to give the final prediction result by integrating the hidden spatial states with gated recurrent unit, which could capture the multi-level spatial dependence and temporal dynamics simultaneously. Experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, NYC Citi Bike and NYC Taxi, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art ones.},

However, it is very challenging since traffic accidents are affected by multiple factors, and have multi-scale dependencies on both spatial and temporal dimensional features. Meanwhile, traffic accidents are rare events, which leads to the zero-inflated issue. Existing traffic accident forecasting methods cannot deal with all above problems simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named GSNet, to learn the spatial-temporal correlations from geographical and semantic aspects for traffic accident risk forecasting. In the model, a Spatial-Temporal Geographical Module is designed to capture the geographical spatial-temporal correlations among regions, while a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Module is proposed to model the semantic spatial-temporal correlations among regions. In addition, a weighted loss function is designed to solve the zero-inflated issue.

However, the transportation modes of nearby sites (e.g. bus stations, bicycle stations) might be different from the target site (e.g. subway station), which results in severe data scarcity issues. To this end, we propose a data-driven approach, named MOHER, to predict the potential crowd flow in a certain mode for a new planned site. Specifically, we first identify the neighbor regions of the target site by examining the geographical proximity as well as the urban function similarity. Then, to aggregate these heterogeneous relations, we devise a cross-mode relational GCN, a novel relation-specific transformation model, which can learn not only the correlation but also the differences between different transportation modes. Afterward, we design an aggregator for inductive potential flow representation. Finally, an LTSM module is used for sequential flow prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of the MOHER framework compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

While previous work has made significant efforts to learn traffic temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies, two key limitations exist in current models. First, only the neighboring spatial correlations among adjacent regions are considered in most existing methods, and the global interregion dependency is ignored. Additionally, these methods fail to encode the complex traffic transition regularities exhibited with time-dependent and multi-resolution in nature. To tackle these challenges, we develop a new traffic prediction framework–Spatial-Temporal Graph Diffusion Network (ST-GDN). In particular, ST-GDN is a hierarchically structured graph neural architecture which learns not only the local region-wise geographical dependencies, but also the spatial semantics from a global perspective. Furthermore, a multi-scale attention network is developed to empower ST-GDN with the capability of capturing multi-level temporal dynamics. Experiments on four real-life traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-GDN outperforms different types of state-of-the-art baselines.},

The proposed approach is evaluated with a real-world trajectory dataset. Experiment results show that the proposed TrGNN model achieves over 5\% error reduction when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches across all metrics for normal traffic, and up to 14\% for atypical traffic during peak hours or abnormal events. The advantage of trajectory transitions especially manifest itself in inferring high fluctuation of flows as well as non-recurrent flow patterns.},

Then, we propose a comprehensive neural network based traffic prediction model, where various effective embeddings or encodings are designed to capture the aforementioned properties. First, we design effective region embeddings to capture two forms of region-level correlations: spatially close regions have similar embeddings, and regions with similar properties (e.g., the number of POIs and the number of roads in a region) other than locations have similar embeddings. Second, we extract the "day-in-week" and "time-in-day" and utilize the temporal periodicity in designing the embeddings for time intervals. Third, we propose an effective encoding for past traffic data which captures two forms of inter-traffic correlations - the correlation between past and future traffic, and the correlation between travel demands and traffic flows within past traffic data. Extensive experiments on two real datasets verify the high effectiveness of our model.},

	abstract = {Correlated time series forecasting plays an essential role in many cyber-physical systems, where entities interact with each other over time. To enable accurate forecasting, it is essential to capture both the temporal dynamics and the correlations among different entities. To capture the former, two popular types of models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and temporal convolution networks (TCNs), are employed. To capture the latter, a graph is constructed to reflect certain relationships among entities and then graph convolution (GC) is applied upon the graph to capture the correlations among the entities. The state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy is achieved by models that combine RNNs or TCNs with GC. However, they neither capture distinct temporal dynamics that exist among different entities nor consider the entity correlations that evolve across time.In this paper, rather than proposing yet another new end-to-end forecasting model, we aim at providing a framework to enhance existing forecasting models, where we propose generic plugins that can be easily integrated into existing solutions to solve the two challenges and thus further enhance their accuracy. Specifically, we propose two plugin neural networks that are able to better capture distinct temporal dynamics for different entities and dynamic entity correlations across time, so that forecasting accuracy is improved while model parameters to be learned are reduced. Experimental results on three real-world correlated time series data sets demonstrate that the proposed framework with the two plugin networks is able to achieve the above goals.},

	abstract = {Forecasting regional ambulance demand plays a fundamental part in dynamic fleet allocation and redeployment. This topic has been gaining increasing significance, as virtually every country is experiencing an aging population, with generally higher level of vulnerability and demand for the emergency medical service (EMS). Although exploring the spatial and temporal correlations in EMS historical records, the existing methods principally consider the former time-invariant, which does not necessarily hold in reality. Moreover, this assumption ignores the fact that the behind-the-scenes dynamics are people, whose demographic profiles and activity patterns could be determinants of regional EMS demands. In this paper, we are therefore motivated to mine the collective daily routines in human mobility, to further represent the evolving spatial correlations. Particularly, we model profiled mobility groups as multiple random walkers and propose a novel bicomponent neural network, including a heterogeneous multi-graph convolution layer and spatio-temporal interlacing attention module, to perform the prediction task. Experimental results on the real-world data verify the effectiveness of introducing dynamic human mobility and the advantage of our approach over the state-of-the-art models.},

	abstract = {Online ride-hailing services have become an important component of urban transportation in recent years. As a fundamental research problem for such services, the timely prediction of passenger demands in different regions is vital for effective traffic flow control. As both spatial and temporal patterns are indispensable passenger demand prediction, relevant research has evolved from pure time series to graph-structured data for modelling historical passenger demand data, where a snapshot graph is constructed for each time slot by connecting region nodes via different relational edges. Consequently, the spatiotemporal passenger demand records naturally carry dynamic patterns in the constructed graphs, where the edges also encode important information about the directions and volume (i.e., weights) of passenger demands between two connected regions. However, existing graph-based solutions fail to simultaneously consider those three crucial aspects of dynamic, directed and weighted (DDW) graphs, leading to limited expressiveness when learning graph representations for passenger demand prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel spatiotemporal graph attention network, namely Gallat (Graph prediction with all attention) as a solution. In Gallat, by comprehensively incorporating those three intrinsic properties of DDW graphs, we build three attention layers to fully capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among different regions across all historical time slots. Our experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that Gallat outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

We present a novel deep model for this task, called "AttConvLSTM", which leverages a convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) along with an attention mechanism, where ConvLSTM keeps spatial information as intact as possible during sequential analysis, and the attention mechanism can focus important crowd flow variations which cannot be identified by the recurrent module. We conducted extensive experiments for performance evaluation using three large datasets, including Beijing Taxi dataset, Rome Taxi dataset, and Chengdu Didi chauffeuring trace. The experimental results show that AttConvLSTM significantly outperforms several widely-used baselines in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), indicating that our approach can deal with crowd flows with different dynamics in both spatial and temporal domains, and make valid predictions several steps ahead.},

	abstract = {Vast amount of data generated from networks of sensors, wearables, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices underscores the need for advanced modeling techniques that leverage the spatio-temporal structure of decentralized data due to the need for edge computation and licensing (data access) issues. While federated learning (FL) has emerged as a framework for model training without requiring direct data sharing and exchange, effectively modeling the complex spatio-temporal dependencies to improve forecasting capabilities still remains an open problem. On the other hand, state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models assume unfettered access to the data, neglecting constraints on data sharing. To bridge this gap, we propose a federated spatio-temporal model -- Cross-Node Federated Graph Neural Network (CNFGNN) -- which explicitly encodes the underlying graph structure using graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture under the constraint of cross-node federated learning, which requires that data in a network of nodes is generated locally on each node and remains decentralized. CNFGNN operates by disentangling the temporal dynamics modeling on devices and spatial dynamics on the server, utilizing alternating optimization to reduce the communication cost, facilitating computations on the edge devices. Experiments on the traffic flow forecasting task show that CNFGNN achieves the best forecasting performance in both transductive and inductive learning settings with no extra computation cost on edge devices, while incurring modest communication cost.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have become one of the most promising methods for traffic speed forecasting. However, when adapting DGNNs for traffic speed forecasting, existing approaches are usually built on a static adjacency matrix (no matter predefined or self-learned) to learn spatial relationships among different road segments, even if the impact of two road segments can be changeable dynamically during a day. Moreover, the future traffic speed cannot only be related with the current traffic speed, but also be affected by other factors such as traffic volumes. To this end, in this paper, we aim to explore these dynamic and multi-faceted spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in traffic data for further unleashing the power of DGNNs for better traffic speed forecasting. Specifically, we design a dynamic graph construction method to learn the time-specific spatial dependencies of road segments. Then, a dynamic graph convolution module is proposed to aggregate hidden states of neighbor nodes to focal nodes by message passing on the dynamic adjacency matrices. Moreover, a multi-faceted fusion module is provided to incorporate the auxiliary hidden states learned from traffic volumes with the primary hidden states learned from traffic speeds. Finally, experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that our method can not only achieve the state-of-the-art prediction performances, but also obtain the explicit and interpretable dynamic spatial relationships of road segments.},

Recently, the availability of massive trajectory data and the success of deep learning motivate a plethora of deep traffic prediction studies. However, the existing neural-network-based approaches tend to ignore the correlations between multiple types of moving objects located in the same spatio-temporal traffic area, which is suboptimal for traffic prediction analytics.In this paper, we propose a multi-source deep traffic prediction framework over spatio-temporal trajectory data, termed as MDTP. The framework includes two phases: spatio-temporal feature modeling and multi-source bridging. We present an enhanced graph convolutional network (GCN) model combined with long short-term memory network (LSTM) to capture the spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics of traffic in the feature modeling phase. In the multi-source bridging phase, we propose two methods, Sum and Concat, to connect the learned features from different trajectory data sources. Extensive experiments on two real-life datasets show that MDTP i) has superior efficiency, compared with classical time-series methods, machine learning methods, and state-of-the-art neural-network-based approaches; ii) offers a significant performance improvement over the single-source traffic prediction approach; and iii) performs traffic predictions in seconds even on tens of millions of trajectory data. we develop MDTP+, a user-friendly interactive system to demonstrate traffic prediction analysis.},

	abstract = {Urban flow prediction benefits smart cities in many aspects, such as traffic management and risk assessment. However, a critical prerequisite for these benefits is having fine-grained knowledge of the city. Thus, unlike previous works that are limited to coarse-grained data, we extend the horizon of urban flow prediction to fine granularity which raises specific challenges: 1) the predominance of inter-grid transitions observed in fine-grained data makes it more complicated to capture the spatial dependencies among grid cells at a global scale; 2) it is very challenging to learn the impact of external factors (e.g., weather) on a large number of grid cells separately. To address these two challenges, we present a Spatio-Temporal Relation Network (STRN) to predict fine-grained urban flows. First, a backbone network is used to learn high-level representations for each cell. Second, we present a Global Relation Module (GloNet) that captures global spatial dependencies much more efficiently compared to existing methods. Third, we design a Meta Learner that takes external factors and land functions (e.g., POI density) as inputs to produce meta knowledge and boost model performances. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The results show that STRN reduces the errors by 7.1\% to 11.5\% compared to the state-of-the-art method while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, a cloud-based system called UrbanFlow 3.0 has been deployed to show the practicality of our approach.},

	abstract = {Recently, practical applications for passenger flow prediction have brought many benefits to urban transportation development. With the development of urbanization, a real-world demand from transportation managers is to construct a new metro station in one city area that never planned before. Authorities are interested in the picture of the future volume of commuters before constructing a new station, and estimate how would it affect other areas. In this paper, this specific problem is termed as potential passenger flow (PPF) prediction, which is a novel and important study connected with urban computing and intelligent transportation systems. For example, an accurate PPF predictor can provide invaluable knowledge to designers, such as the advice of station scales and influences on other areas, etc. To address this problem, we propose a multi-view localized correlation learning method. The core idea of our strategy is to learn the passenger flow correlations between the target areas and their localized areas with adaptive-weight. To improve the prediction accuracy, other domain knowledge is involved via a multi-view learning process. We conduct intensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method with real-world official transportation datasets. The results demonstrate that our method can achieve excellent performance compared with other available baselines. Besides, our method can provide an effective solution to the cold-start problem in the recommender system as well, which proved by its outperformed experimental results.},

Indeed, the effective prediction of city-wide parking availability can improve parking efficiency, help urban planning, and ultimately alleviate city congestion. However, it is a non-trivial task for predicting city-wide parking availability because of three major challenges: 1) the non-Euclidean spatial autocorrelation among parking lots, 2) the dynamic temporal autocorrelation inside of and between parking lots, and 3) the scarcity of information about real-time parking availability obtained from real-time sensors (e.g., camera, ultrasonic sensor, and GPS). To this end, we propose Semi-supervised Hierarchical Recurrent Graph Neural Network (SHARE) for predicting city-wide parking availability. Specifically, we first propose a hierarchical graph convolution structure to model non-Euclidean spatial autocorrelation among parking lots. Along this line, a contextual graph convolution block and a soft clustering graph convolution block are respectively proposed to capture local and global spatial dependencies between parking lots. Additionally, we adopt a recurrent neural network to incorporate dynamic temporal dependencies of parking lots. Moreover, we propose a parking availability approximation module to estimate missing real-time parking availabilities from both spatial and temporal domain. Finally, experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the prediction performance of {\textbackslash}hmgnn outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines.},

To the best of our knowledge, existing models for OD flow prediction cannot tackle all of these three issues simultaneously. We propose Multi-Perspective Graph Convolutional Networks (MPGCN) to capture the complex dependencies. Our proposed model first utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract temporal features for each OD pair and then learns the spatial dependency of origins and destinations by a two-dimensional graph convolutional network. Furthermore, we design a dynamic graph together with two static graphs to capture the complicated spatial dependencies and use an average strategy to obtain the final predicted OD flow. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale and real-world datasets, which not only demonstrate our design philosophy but also validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Origin-destination (OD) matrices are used widely in transportation and logistics to record the travel cost (e.g., travel speed or greenhouse gas emission) between pairs of OD regions during different intervals within a day. We model a travel cost as a distribution because when traveling between a pair of OD regions, different vehicles may travel at different speeds even during the same interval, e.g., due to different driving styles or different waiting times at intersections. This yields stochastic OD matrices. We consider an increasingly pertinent setting where a set of vehicle trips is used for instantiating OD matrices. Since the trips may not cover all OD pairs for each interval, the resulting OD matrices are likely to be sparse. We then address the problem of forecasting complete, near future OD matrices from sparse, historical OD matrices. To solve this problem, we propose a generic learning framework that (i) employs matrix factorization and graph convolutional neural networks to contend with the data sparseness while capturing spatial correlations and that (ii) captures spatio-temporal dynamics via recurrent neural networks extended with graph convolutions. Empirical studies using two taxi trajectory data sets offer detailed insight into the properties of the framework and indicate that it is effective.},

However, the prediction quality is limited to the intrinsic properties that are present in the mined patterns. In addition, these mined patterns frequently fail to sufficiently capture many realistic characteristics of true congestion evolution. In this paper, we propose a representation learning framework to characterize and predict congestion evolution between any pair of road segments. Specifically, we build dynamic attributed networks (DAN) to incorporate both dynamic and static impact factors while preserving dynamic topological structures. We propose a Deep Meta Learning Model (DMLM) for learning representations of road segments which support accurate prediction of congestion evolution. DMLM relies on matrix factorization techniques and meta-LSTM modules to exploit temporal correlations at multiple scales, and employ meta-Attention modules to merge heterogeneous features while learning the time-varying impacts of both dynamic and static features. Compared to all state-of-the art methods, our framework achieves significantly better prediction performance on two congestion evolution behaviors (propagation and decay) when evaluated using real-world dataset.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of traffic sensors deployed, a massive amount of traffic flow data are collected, revealing the long-term evolution of traffic flows and the gradual expansion of traffic networks. How to accurately forecasting these traffic flow attracts the attention of researchers as it is of great significance for improving the efficiency of transportation systems. However, existing methods mainly focus on the spatial-temporal correlation of static networks, leaving the problem of efficiently learning models on networks with expansion and evolving patterns less studied. To tackle this problem, we propose a Streaming Traffic Flow Forecasting Framework, TrafficStream, based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Continual Learning (CL), achieving accurate predictions and high efficiency. Firstly, we design a traffic pattern fusion method, cleverly integrating the new patterns that emerged during the long-term period into the model. A JS-divergence-based algorithm is proposed to mine new traffic patterns. Secondly, we introduce CL to consolidate the knowledge learned previously and transfer them to the current model. Specifically, we adopt two strategies: historical data replay and parameter smoothing. We construct a streaming traffic dataset to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate its excellent potential to extract traffic patterns with high efficiency on long-term streaming network scene.

It is a challenging task due to the complicated spatialtemporal correlation. While many studies have been done in recent years, they fail to simultaneously and effectively model the spatial correlation and temporal variations among population ﬂows. In this paper, we propose Convolution based Sequential and Cross Network (CSCNet) to solve these difﬁculties. On the one hand, we design a CNN based sequential structure with progressively merging the ﬂow features from different time in different CNN layers to model the spatial-temporal information simultaneously. On the other hand, we make use of the transition ﬂow as the proxy to efﬁciently and explicitly capture the dynamic correlation between different types of population ﬂows. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate that CSCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by reducing the prediction error around 7.7\%∼10.4\%.},

Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic data, deep learning approaches have attracted much interest in recent years. However, few methods are satisfied with both long and short-term prediction tasks. Target at the shortcomings of existing studies, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Long Short-term Graph Convolutional Networks (LSGCN) to tackle both traffic prediction tasks. In our framework, we propose a new graph attention network called cosAtt, and integrate both cosAtt and graph convolution networks (GCN) into a spatial gated block. By the spatial gated block and gated linear units convolution (GLU), LSGCN can efficiently capture complex spatial-temporal features and obtain stable prediction results. Experiments with three real-world traffic datasets verify the effectiveness of LSGCN.},

For example, New York has 1.4 million cars and 4.4 million onstreet parking spaces, but it is still not easy to ﬁnd a parking place near our destination, especially during peak hours. The reason is the lack of prediction of parking behavior. If we could provide parking behavior in advance, we can ease this parking problem that affects human well-being. We observe that parking lots have periodic parking patterns, which is an important factor for parking behavior prediction. Unfortunately, existing work ignores such periodic parking patterns in parking behavior prediction, and thus incurs low accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose PewLSTM, a novel periodic weather-aware LSTM model that successfully predicts the parking behavior based on historical records, weather, environments, and weekdays. PewLSTM has been successfully integrated into a real parking space reservation system, ThsParking, which is one of the top smart parking platforms in China. Based on 452,480 real parking records in 683 days from 10 parking lots, PewLSTM yields 85.3\% parking prediction accuracy, which is about 20\% higher than the state-of-the-art parking behavior prediction method.

Recently, many deep neural network models have been proposed to make accurate prediction. However, manually designing neural networks requires amount of expert efforts and ST domain knowledge. How to automatically construct a general neural network for diverse spatio-temporal predication tasks in cities? In this paper, we study Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for spatio-temporal prediction and propose an efficient spatio-temporal neural architecture search method, entitled AutoST. To our best knowledge, the search space is an important human prior to the success of NAS in different applications while current NAS models concentrated on optimizing search strategy in the fixed search space. Thus, we design a novel search space tailored for ST-domain which consists of two categories of components: (i) optional convolution operations at each layer to automatically extract multi-range spatio-temporal dependencies; (ii) learnable skip connections among layers to dynamically fuse low- and high-level ST-features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-word spatio-temporal prediction tasks, including taxi flow and crowd flow, showing that the learned network architectures can significantly improve the performance of representative ST neural network models. Furthermore, our proposed efficient NAS approach searches 8-10x faster than state-of-the-art NAS approaches, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of AutoST.},

In this paper, we develop a novel ETA learning system named as CompactETA, which provides an accurate online travel time inference within 100 microseconds. In the proposed method, we encode high order spatial and temporal dependency into sophisticated representations by applying graph attention network on a spatiotemporal weighted road network graph. We further encode the sequential information of the travel route by positional encoding to avoid the recurrent network structure. The properly learnt representations enable us to apply a very simple multi-layer perceptron model for online real-time inference. Evaluation of both offline experiments and online A/B testing verifies that CompactETA reduces the inference latency by more than 100 times compared to a state-of-the-art system, while maintains competing prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {The task of travel time estimation (TTE), which estimates the travel time for a given route and departure time, plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems such as navigation, route planning, and ride-hailing services. This task is challenging because of many essential aspects, such as traffic prediction and contextual information. First, the accuracy of traffic prediction is strongly correlated with the traffic speed of the road segments in a route. Existing work mainly adopts spatial-temporal graph neural networks to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction, where spatial and temporal information is used separately. However, one drawback is that the spatial and temporal correlations are not fully exploited to obtain better accuracy. Second, contextual information of a route, i.e., the connections of adjacent road segments in the route, is an essential factor that impacts the driving speed. Previous work mainly uses sequential encoding models to address this issue. However, it is difficult to scale up sequential models to large-scale real-world services. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural framework named ConSTGAT, which integrates traffic prediction and contextual information to address these two problems. Specifically, we first propose a spatial-temporal graph neural network that adopts a novel graph attention mechanism, which is designed to fully exploit the joint relations of spatial and temporal information. Then, in order to efficiently take advantage of the contextual information, we design a computationally efficient model that applies convolutions over local windows to capture a route's contextual information and further employs multi-task learning to improve the performance. In this way, the travel time of each road segment can be computed in parallel and in advance. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of ConSTGAT. In addition, ConSTGAT has already been deployed in production at Baidu Maps, and it successfully keeps serving tens of billions of requests every day. This confirms that ConSTGAT is a practical and robust solution for large-scale real-world TTE services.},

Moreover, we employ three components to model temporal information from recent periods, daily periods and weekly periods respectively. Each component comprises temporal convolutions and graph convolutions to learn representations of the spatiotemporal heterogeneous information for ETA task. Experiments on large-scale datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed HetETA beyond the state-of-the-art methods, and show the importance of representation learning of heterogeneous information networks for ETA task.},

Owing to the non-stationary nature of road traffic, forecasting accuracy is fundamentally limited by the lack of contextual information. To address this issue, we propose the Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (H-STGCN), which is able to "deduce" future travel time by exploiting the data of upcoming traffic volume. Specifically, we propose an algorithm to acquire the upcoming traffic volume from an online navigation engine. Taking advantage of the piecewise-linear flow-density relationship, a novel transformer structure converts the upcoming volume into its equivalent in travel time. We combine this signal with the commonly-utilized travel-time signal, and then apply graph convolution to capture the spatial dependency. Particularly, we construct a compound adjacency matrix which reflects the innate traffic proximity. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The results show that H-STGCN remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various metrics, especially for the prediction of non-recurring congestion.},

	abstract = {Effective long-term predictions have been increasingly demanded in urban-wise data mining systems. Many practical applications, such as accident prevention and resource pre-allocation, require an extended period for preparation. However, challenges come as long-term prediction is highly error-sensitive, which becomes more critical when predicting urban-wise phenomena with complicated and dynamic spatial-temporal correlation. Specifically, since the amount of valuable correlation is limited, enormous irrelevant features introduce noises that trigger increased prediction errors. Besides, after each time step, the errors can traverse through the correlations and reach the spatial-temporal positions in every future prediction, leading to significant error propagation. To address these issues, we propose a Dynamic Switch-Attention Network (DSAN) with a novel Multi-Space Attention (MSA) mechanism that measures the correlations between inputs and outputs explicitly. To filter out irrelevant noises and alleviate the error propagation, DSAN dynamically extracts valuable information by applying self-attention over the noisy input and bridges each output directly to the purified inputs via implementing a switch-attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments on two spatial-temporal prediction tasks, we demonstrate the superior advantage of DSAN in both short-term and long-term predictions.

We propose a novel neural network based prediction model that fully exploits an important fact neglected by the literature -- for a past OD trip its travel time is usually affiliated with the trajectory it travels along, whereas it does not exist during prediction. At the training phase, our goal is to design novel representations for the OD input and its affiliated trajectory, such that they are close to each other in the latent space. First, we match the OD pairs and their affiliated (historical) trajectories to road networks, and utilize road segment embeddings to represent their spatial properties. Later, we match the timestamps associated with trajectories to time slots and utilize time slot embeddings to represent the temporal properties. Next, we build a temporal graph to capture the weekly and daily periodicity of time slot embeddings. Last, we design an effective encoding to represent the spatial and temporal properties of trajectories. To bind each OD input to its affiliated trajectory, we also encode the OD input into a hidden representation, and make the hidden representation close to the spatio-temporal representation of the trajectory. At the prediction phase, we only use the OD input, get the hidden representation of the OD input, and use it to generate the travel time. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that our method achieves high effectiveness and outperforms existing methods.},

	abstract = {As a healthy, efficient and green alternative to motorized urban travel, bike sharing has been increasingly popular, leading to wide deployment and use of bikes instead of cars. Accurate bike-flow prediction at the individual station level is essential for bike sharing service. Due to the spatial and temporal complexities of traffic networks and the lack of data-driven design for bike stations, existing methods cannot predict the fine-grained bike flows to/from each station. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel data-driven spatio-temporal Graph attention convolutional neural network for Bikestation-level flow prediction (GBikes). We develop data-driven and spatio-temporal designs, and model bike stations (nodes) and inter-station bike rides (edges) as a graph. In particular, we design a novel graph attention convolutional neural network (GACNN) with attention mechanisms capturing and differentiating station-to-station correlations. Multi-level temporal closeness, spatial distances and other external factors (e.g., weather and points of interest) are jointly considered for comprehensive learning and accurate prediction of bike flows at each station. Extensive experiments upon a total of over 11 million trips collected from three large-scale bike-sharing systems in New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles have corroborated GBikes’s significant improvement of accuracy, robustness and effectiveness over prior work.},

It aims to predict the inflow (the traffic of crowds entering a region in a given time interval) and outflow (the traffic of crowds leaving a region for other places) of each region in the city with knowing the historical flow data. In this paper, we propose DeepSTN+, a deep learning-based convolutional model, to predict crowd flows in the metropolis. First, DeepSTN+ employs the ConvPlus structure to model the longrange spatial dependence among crowd flows in different regions. Further, PoI distributions and time factor are combined to express the effect of location attributes to introduce prior knowledge of the crowd movements. Finally, we propose an effective fusion mechanism to stabilize the training process, which further improves the performance. Extensive experimental results based on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model, i.e., DeepSTN+ reduces the error of the crowd flow prediction by approximately 8\%∼13\% compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Event crowd management has been a significant research topic with high social impact. When some big events happen such as an earthquake, typhoon, and national festival, crowd management becomes the first priority for governments (e.g. police) and public service operators (e.g. subway/bus operator) to protect people's safety or maintain the operation of public infrastructures. However, under such event situations, human behavior will become very different from daily routines, which makes prediction of crowd dynamics at big events become highly challenging, especially at a citywide level. Therefore in this study, we aim to extract the deep trend only from the current momentary observations and generate an accurate prediction for the trend in the short future, which is considered to be an effective way to deal with the event situations. Motivated by these, we build an online system called DeepUrbanEvent which can iteratively take citywide crowd dynamics from the current one hour as input and report the prediction results for the next one hour as output. A novel deep learning architecture built with recurrent neural networks is designed to effectively model these highly-complex sequential data in an analogous manner to video prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methodology to the existing approaches. Lastly, we apply our prototype system to multiple big real-world events and show that it is highly deployable as an online crowd management system.},

	abstract = {Ride-hailing applications are becoming more and more popular for providing drivers and passengers with convenient ride services, especially in metropolises like Beijing or New York. To obtain the passengers' mobility patterns, the online platforms of ride services need to predict the number of passenger demands from one region to another in advance. We formulate this problem as an Origin-Destination Matrix Prediction (ODMP) problem. Though this problem is essential to large-scale providers of ride services for helping them make decisions and some providers have already put it forward in public, existing studies have not solved this problem well. One of the main reasons is that the ODMP problem is more challenging than the common demand prediction. Besides the number of demands in a region, it also requires the model to predict the destinations of them. In addition, data sparsity is a severe issue. To solve the problem effectively, we propose a unified model, Grid-Embedding based Multi-task Learning (GEML) which consists of two components focusing on spatial and temporal information respectively. The Grid-Embedding part is designed to model the spatial mobility patterns of passengers and neighboring relationships of different areas, the pre-weighted aggregator of which aims to sense the sparsity and range of data. The Multi-task Learning framework focuses on modeling temporal attributes and capturing several objectives of the ODMP problem. The evaluation of our model is conducted on real operational datasets from UCAR and Didi. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our GEML against the state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Spatial-temporal prediction is a fundamental problem for constructing smart city, which is useful for tasks such as traffic control, taxi dispatching, and environment policy making. Due to data collection mechanism, it is common to see data collection with unbalanced spatial distributions. For example, some cities may release taxi data for multiple years while others only release a few days of data; some regions may have constant water quality data monitored by sensors whereas some regions only have a small collection of water samples. In this paper, we tackle the problem of spatial-temporal prediction for the cities with only a short period of data collection. We aim to utilize the long-period data from other cities via transfer learning. Different from previous studies that transfer knowledge from one single source city to a target city, we are the first to leverage information from multiple cities to increase the stability of transfer. Specifically, our proposed model is designed as a spatial-temporal network with a meta-learning paradigm. The meta-learning paradigm learns a well-generalized initialization of the spatial-temporal network, which can be effectively adapted to target cities. In addition, a pattern-based spatial-temporal memory is designed to distill long-term temporal information (i.e., periodicity). We conduct extensive experiments on two tasks: traffic (taxi and bike) prediction and water quality prediction. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model over several competitive baseline models.},

	abstract = {Accurate assessment of road conditions can effectively alleviate traffic congestion and guide people’s travel plans, traffic control decisions of transportation departments, and formulation of traffic-related laws and regulations. This paper proposes a quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and adaptive hybrid exponential smoothing with residual correction (AHES-RC) for the nonlinearity and randomness of traffic flow. In the proposed algorithm, the single–double-exponential smoothing method is mixed with adaptive weights to form AHES, a new method of mixing weights according to real-time traffic trend changes. After the residual correction of AHES is calculated by the extreme learning machine algorithm, the parameters of AHES-RC are optimized using QPSO to improve the prediction accuracy further. This paper comprehensively compares the QPSO-AHES-RC algorithm with other benchmark models through testing on 26 real-world data sets. The results show that the proposed algorithm can adaptive forecasting under various traffic conditions, yielding the best forecasting performance in terms of various forecast error metrics. Compared with advanced machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and CatBoost, the mean RMSE and mean MAPE have been improved by over 20\% on average. In addition, it is revealed that the real-time dynamic capture of traffic flow can effectively improve prediction accuracy.},

Recently, many deep learning models have been proposed for spatial-temporal dependency modeling. While numerous deep learning models have been developed for spatial-temporal dependency modeling, most rely on different types of convolutions to extract spatial and temporal correlations separately. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning framework for traffic prediction called GraphSAGE-based Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (DST-GraphSAGE), which can capture dynamic spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously. Our model utilizes a spatial-temporal GraphSAGE module to extract localized spatial-temporal correlations from past observations of a node’s spatial neighbors. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism is incorporated to dynamically learn weights between traffic nodes based on graph features. Additionally, to capture long-term trends in traffic data, we employ dilated causal convolution as the temporal convolution layer. A series of numerical experiments are conducted on five real-world datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our model for spatial-temporal dependency modeling.},

Considering the model prediction performance, efficiency, and data accessibility, a SpatioTemporal Knowledge Expansion and Consolidation (STKEC) framework is proposed. This framework contains an influence-based knowledge expansion strategy to help the spatiotemporal learning model integrate new spatiotemporal traffic patterns and a memory-augmented knowledge consolidation mechanism to preserve the learned spatiotemporal patterns without accessing the data in previous graphs.

In this paper, we use dangerous driving statistics from driving log data and multi-graph learning to enhance predictive performance. We first conduct geographical and temporal correlation analyses to quantify the relationship between dangerous driving and actual accidents. Then, to learn various dependencies between districts besides the traditional adjacency matrix, we simultaneously model both static and dynamic graphs representing the spatio-temporal contextual relationships with heterogeneous environmental data, including the dangerous driving behavior. A graph is generated for each type of the relationships. Ultimately, we propose an end-to-end framework, called MG-TAR, to effectively learn the association of multiple graphs for accident risk prediction by adopting multi-view graph neural networks with a multi-attention module. Thorough experiments on ten real-world datasets show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, MG-TAR reduces the error of predicting the accident risk by up to 23\% and improves the accuracy of predicting the most dangerous areas by up to 27\%.},

	abstract = {With the acceleration of urbanization, the dynamic passenger flow has an ever-growing impact on the actual train operation. In this paper, we propose a learning based intelligent train regulation method with dynamic passenger flow prediction. To capture the characteristics of the dynamic metro passenger flow, a convolutional neural network is established to predict the real-time passenger flow from two dimensions including space and time. As the prediction accuracy is restricted by the insufficiency of the practical passenger flow data, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network is constructed to generate data that have the same distribution as the original passenger flow dataset. Then, by considering the effects of the dynamic passenger flow on the train operation and the train capacity constraints, the dynamic train regulation is formulated as a multi-stage optimal control problem with the objective function of minimizing the train traction energy consumption and the total traveling time of passengers. To efficiently obtain the optimal regulation strategy at each decision step, a deep Q-network algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem such the dimensionality curse caused by the excessive state space is avoided. The numerical experiments demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and model.},

	abstract = {Short-term traffic speed prediction is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and the accuracy of the model largely determines the performance of real-time traffic control and management. In this study, a short-term traffic speed prediction method based on the spatial-temporal analysis of traffic flow and a combined deep-learning model, and a hybrid spatial-temporal feature selection algorithm (STFSA) of a convolutional neural network–gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU)) is initially developed. Specifically, the STFSA is firstly employed to reconstruct the spatial-temporal matrix of traffic speed based on temporal continuity and spatial characteristics, and then this matrix is considered as the input feature of the prediction model. After this, the nonlinear fitting ability of the CNN is adopted to extract deep features from the convolutional and pooling layers for model training. Finally, by combining the timing and long-range dependence of the captured data with the forward GRU and the reverse GRU, the accuracy of the prediction result is further improved. The validity of the proposed model can be verified by comparing the prediction results with the actual traffic data. Accordingly, in the case study, the performance is compared with various benchmark methods under the same prediction scenario, verifying the superiority of the proposed model.},

However, current IoV solutions are unable to capture traffic data both accurately and securely. Another drawback of current IoV models that are based on deep learning is that the methods used do not tune hyperparameters efficiently. In this paper, a new system known as Secure and Intelligent System for the Internet of Vehicles (SISIV) is developed. A deep learning architecture based on graph convolutional networks and an attention mechanism are implemented. In addition, blockchain technology is used to protect data transmission between nodes in the IoV system. Moreover, the hyperparameters of the generated deep learning model are intelligently selected using a branch-and-bound technique. To validate SISIV, experiments were conducted on four networked vehicle databases dealing with prediction problems. In terms of forecasting rate ( {\textgreater} 90\%), F-measure ( {\textgreater} 80\%), and attack detection ({\textless} 75\%), the results clearly show the superiority of SISIV over baseline systems. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art solutions based on traffic prediction, SISIV enables efficient and reliable prediction of traffic flow in an IoV context.},

Owing to their power in analyzing graph-structured data, they have become broadly popular in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications as well. Despite their widespread applications in different transportation domains, there is no comprehensive review of recent advancements and future research directions that covers all transportation areas. Accordingly, in this survey, for the first time, we provide an overview of GNN studies in the general domain of ITS. Unlike previous surveys, which have been limited to traffic forecasting problems, we explore how GNN frameworks have evolved for different ITS applications, including traffic forecasting, demand prediction, autonomous vehicles, intersection management, parking management, urban planning, and transportation safety. Also, we micro-categorize the studies based on their transportation application to identify domain-specific research directions, opportunities, and challenges, which have been missing in previous surveys. Moreover, we identify unique and undiscussed research opportunities and directions, which is the result of reviewing a wide range of transportation applications. The neglected role of edge and graph learning in ITS applications, developing multi-modal models, and exploiting the power of unsupervised and reinforcement learning methods for developing more powerful GNNs are some examples of such new discussions in this survey. Finally, we have identified popular baseline models and datasets in each transportation domain, which facilitate the development and evaluation of future GNN-based frameworks.},

Dynamic interaction of multiple spatial relationships will influence the accuracy of traffic prediction. However, many existing methods only consider static spatial relationships, which restricts the accuracy of the prediction. To address the above problem, in this article, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion Network (DMGF-Net) to model the spatial-temporal correlations in traffic network. In the DMGF-Net, the fusion graph is designed to leverage and extract the various spatial correlations between different regions by fusing spatial graph, semantic graph, and spatial-semantic graph. Further, to dynamically learn the importance of different neighbors, we design the Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Unit (DSTU), which can adjust the aggregation weights of different neighbors by combining the convolution operation and the attention mechanism. It can selectively aggregate spatial-temporal features from different neighbors. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that effectiveness of our model, especially on PEMS08, our model achieves an increase of about 8.55\% and 7.55\% in terms of MAE and RMSE than the static model STGCN.},

Existing works utilize transfer learning to solve the data scarcity problem, but they ignore the differences in data distributions across cities, which leads to the ineffectiveness of knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial model with knowledge transfer for spatio-temporal prediction across cities, entitled CityTrans. Specifically, 1) the self-adaptive spatio-temporal knowledge (namely ST-Knowledge) is mined, to learn the latent spatial and temporal patterns among cities; 2) the domain-adversarial training strategy is introduced to enhance domain invariance; 3) a knowledge attention mechanism is proposed to extract the transferable information from the ST-Knowledge. Note that our CityTrans is an end-to-end domain adversarial spatio-temporal network without two-stage training (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two spatio-temporal prediction tasks: traffic (flow and speed) prediction, and air quality prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that CityTrans outperforms state-of-the-art models on all tasks by a significant margin.},

	abstract = {Recently, forecasting the crowd flows has become an important research topic, and plentiful technologies have achieved good performances. As we all know, the flow at a citywide level is in a mixed state with several basic patterns (e.g., commuting, working, and commercial) caused by the city area functional distributions (e.g., developed commercial areas, educational areas and parks). However, existing technologies have been criticized for their lack of considering the differences in the flow patterns among regions since they want to build only one comprehensive model to learn the mixed flow tensors. Recognizing this limitation, we present a new perspective on flow prediction and propose an explainable framework named ST-ExpertNet, which can adopt every spatial-temporal model and train a set of functional experts devoted to specific flow patterns. Technically, we train a bunch of experts based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE), which guides each expert to specialize in different kinds of flow patterns in sample spaces by using the gating network. We define several criteria, including comprehensiveness, sparsity, and preciseness, to construct the experts for better interpretability and performances. We conduct experiments on a wide range of real-world taxi and bike datasets in Beijing and NYC. The visualizations of the expert's intermediate results demonstrate that our ST-ExpertNet successfully disentangles the city's mixed flow tensors along with the city layout, e.g., the urban ring road structure. Different network architectures, such as ST-ResNet, ConvLSTM, and CNN, have been adopted into our ST-ExpertNet framework for experiments and the results demonstrates the superiority of our framework in both interpretability and performances.},

	abstract = {Spatio-temporal graphs (STGs) are important structures to describe urban sensory data, e.g., traffic speed and air quality. Predicting over spatio-temporal graphs enables many essential applications in intelligent cities, such as traffic management and environment analysis. Recently, many deep learning models have been proposed for spatio-temporal graph prediction and achieved significant results. However, manually designing neural networks requires rich domain knowledge and heavy expert efforts, making it impractical for real-world deployments. Therefore, we study automated neural architecture search for spatio-temporal graphs, which meets three challenges: 1) how to define search space for capturing complex spatio-temporal correlations; 2) how to jointly model the explicit and implicit relationships between nodes of an STG; and 3) how to learn network weight parameters related to meta graphs of STGs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel neural architecture search framework, entitled AutoSTG+, for automated spatio-temporal graph prediction. In our AutoSTG+, spatial graph convolution and temporal convolution operations are adopted in the search space of AutoSTG+ to capture complex spatio-temporal correlations. Besides, we propose to employ the meta-learning technique to learn the adjacency matrices of spatial graph convolution layers and kernels of temporal convolution layers from the meta knowledge of meta graphs. And specifically, such meta-knowledge is learned by graph meta-knowledge learners, which iteratively aggregate knowledge on the attributed graphs and the similarity graphs. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate that AutoSTG+ can find effective network architectures and achieve up to about 20\% relative improvements compared to human-designed networks.},

	abstract = {In the intelligent transportation system, traffic forecasting, which is generally characterized as a graph spatial-temporal prediction task, plays a crucial role. It is challenging to generate reliable forecast results due to the complexity of traffic topological information and the inherent uncertainty of road traffic circumstances. Existing works generally focus on modeling spatial dependency on static graph structures, but ignore dynamic relations between road segments and cannot extract long-range traffic dependencies in spatial-temporal domains. To bridge the above gaps, we present a novel framework, called Dynamic Multi-Hop Graph Attention Network (DMGAN). Specifically, we leverage dynamic graph modeling to capture time-varying relations across road sections and introduce the multi-hop operation in each message propagation layer to extract long-range spatial dependency. Meanwhile, we develop a fusion-attention module, preserving both local and global hidden layer outputs of the encoder, to capture both long- and short-term temporal dependencies jointly. In this way, our method can fully model complex time-varying traffic topology information and capture the internal patterns of traffic series by integrating dynamic graph structure and temporal attention component. DGMAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in three metrics, as demonstrated by experimental findings on four real-world public traffic datasets, METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, PEMS03, and PEMS07.

As e-scooters are getting deployed dynamically and flexibly across city regions that expand and/or shrink, accurate prediction of the e-scooter distribution given the reconfigured regions becomes essential for city planning. We present GCScoot, a novel flow distribution prediction approach for reconfiguring urban DES systems. Based on real-world datasets with reconfiguration, we analyze e-scooter distribution features and flow dynamics for the data-driven designs. We propose a novel spatio-temporal graph capsule neural network within GCScoot to predict future dockless e-scooter flows given the reconfigured regions. GCScoot pre-processes historical spatial e-scooter distributions into flow graph structures, where discretized city regions are considered as nodes and inter-region flows as edges. To facilitate initial training, we cluster the regions and generate virtual data for new deployment regions based on their peers in the same cluster. Given above designs, the region-to-region correlations embedded within the temporal flow graphs are captured via the multi-graph capsule convolutional neural network which accurately predicts the DES flows. Extensive studies upon four e-scooter datasets (total {\textgreater}{\textgreater}3.4 million rides) in four populous US cities have corroborated accuracy and effectiveness of GCScoot in predicting the e-scooter distributions.},

Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (GCRNN) are the state-of-the-art methods for this problem, which learn temporal dependencies by RNNs and exploit pairwise node proximity to model spatial dependencies. However, the spatial relations in real data are not simply pairwise but sometimes in a higher order among multiple nodes. Moreover, spatio-temporal sequences deriving from nature are often regulated by known or unknown physical laws. GCRNNs rarely take into account the underlying physics in real-world systems, which may result in degenerated performance. To address these issues, we devise a general model called Mixed-Order Relation-Aware RNN (MixRNN+) for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, our MixRNN+ captures the complex mixed-order spatial relations of nodes through a newly proposed building block called Mixer, and simultaneously addressing the underlying physics by the integration of a new residual update strategy. Experimental results on three forecasting tasks in smart city applications (including traffic speed, taxi flow, and air quality prediction) demonstrate the superiority of our model against the state-of-the-art methods.

To address this issue, we propose the spatiotemporal potential energy field model (ST-PEF+), which applies the field theory for human mobility to interpret the underlying mechanisms of urban traffic, and introduces the theory into data-driven deep learning models. ST-PEF+ consists of a PEF extraction module and a data-driven module. Inspired by the field theory for human mobility, the PEF extraction module adopts an algorithm to decompose the grid-based traffic flow graph into several polytree-based potential energy fields (PEFs), where traffic flows from high potential locations to low potential locations, just as water is driven by the gravity field. We also provide a theoretical analysis to ensure that the polytree decomposition algorithm can decompose any traffic flow graph. In the data-driven module, ST-PEF+ learns a spatiotemporal deep learning model to predict the dynamics of PEFs. The model adopts correlation-adaptive neural network structures, which consists of a temporal component for temporal correlations and a spatial component for spatial correlations. The temporal component employs a GRU and DCN combined structure to capture both short-term autocorrelation and long-term repeating patterns of PEFs. The spatial component extends the GAT using weighted directed attention to model the asymmetric spatial structure in PEFs. The prediction results of traffic flow are finally derived from PEFs that are predicted by the spatiotemporal deep learning model. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real-world traffic datasets. The results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, case studies confirm that the PEFs learned in our framework can reveal the underlying mechanisms of urban traffic, thus improving the model interpretability.},

To address the challenges, we propose a graph and attentive multi-path convolutional network (GAMCN) model to predict traffic conditions such as traffic speed across a given road network into the future. Our model focuses on the spatial and temporal factors that impact traffic conditions. To model the spatial factors, we propose a variant of the graph convolutional network (GCN) named LPGCN to embed road network graph vertices into a latent space, where vertices with correlated traffic conditions are close to each other. To model the temporal factors, we use a multi-path convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the joint impact of different combinations of past traffic conditions on the future traffic conditions. Such a joint impact is further modulated by an attention generated from an embedding of the prediction time, which encodes the periodic patterns of traffic conditions. We evaluate our model on real-world road networks and traffic data. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-art traffic prediction models by up to 18.9\% in terms of prediction errors and 23.4\% in terms of prediction efficiency.},

	abstract = {Crowd flow prediction, which aims to predict the in/out flows of different areas of a city, plays a critically important role in many real-world applications including intelligent transportation systems and public safety. The challenges of this problem lie in both the dynamic mobility patterns of crowds and the complex spatial-temporal correlations. Meanwhile, crowd flow is highly correlated to and affected by the Origin-Destination (OD) locations of the flow trajectories, which is largely ignored by existing works. In this paper, we study the novel problem of predicting the crowd flow and flow OD simultaneously, and propose a Multi-task Bayes-enhanced Adversarial Spatial Temporal Network entitled MBA-STNet to effectively address it. MBA-STNet adopts a shared-private framework which contains private spatial-temporal encoders, a shared spatial-temporal encoder, and decoders to learn the task-specific features and shared features. To effectively extract discriminative shared features, an adversarial loss on shared feature extraction is incorporated to reduce information redundancy. A Bayesian heterogeneous Spatio-temporal Attention Network is designed to learn the complex spatio-temporal correlations and alleviate the problem of data uncertainty. We also design an attentive temporal queue to capture the complex temporal dependency automatically without the help of domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations are conducted over the bike and taxicab trip datasets in New York. The results demonstrate that the proposed MBA-STNet is superior to state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {The drastic increase of metro passengers in recent years inevitably causes the overcrowdedness in the metro systems. Accurately predicting passenger flows at metro stations is critical for efficient metro system management, which helps alleviate such overcrowdedness. Compared to the prevalent next-step prediction, multi-step passenger flow prediction could prominently increase the prediction duration and reveal finer-grained passenger flow variations, which better helps metro system management. Thus, in this paper, we address the problem of multi-step metro station passenger (MSP) flow prediction. In light of MSP flows’ unique spatial-temporal characteristics, we propose STP-TrellisNets+, which for the first time augments the newly-emerged temporal convolutional framework TrellisNet for multi-step MSP flow prediction. The temporal module of STP-TrellisNets+ (named CP-TrellisNetsED) employs a Closeness TrellisNet followed by a Periodicity TrellisNets-based Encoder-Decoder (P-TrellisNetsED) to jointly capture the short- and long-term temporal correlation of MSP flows. In parallel to CP-TrellisNetsED, its spatial module (named GC-TrellisNetsED) adopts a novel transfer flow-based metric to characterize the spatial correlation among MSP flows, and implements another TrellisNetsED on multiple diffusion graph convolutional networks (DGCNs) in time-series order to capture the dynamics of such spatial correlation. Extensive experiments with two large-scale real-world automated fare collection datasets demonstrate that STP-TrellisNets+ outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, the complex process of traffic anomaly is affected by both various static factors and dynamic interactions. The recent evolving representation learning provides a new possibility to understand this complicated process, but with challenges of imbalanced data distribution and heterogeneity of features. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal evolution model named SNIPERfor learning intricate feature interactions to predict traffic anomalies. Specifically, we design spatio-temporal encoders to transform spatio-temporal information into vector space indicating their natural relationship. Then, we propose a temporally dynamical evolving embedding method to pay more attention to rare traffic anomalies and develop an effective attention-based multiple graph convolutional network to formulate the spatially mutual influence from three different perspectives. The FC-LSTM is adopted to aggregate the heterogeneous features considering the spatio-temporal influences. Finally, a loss function is designed to overcome the ’over-smoothing’ and solve the imbalanced data problem. Extensive experiments show that SNIPER averagely outperforms state-of-the-arts by 3.9\%, 0.9\%, 1.9\% and 1.6\% on Chicago datasets, and 2.4\%, 0.6\%, 2.6\% and 1.3\% on New York City datasets in metrics of AUC-PR, AUC-ROC, F1 score, and accuracy, respectively.},

	abstract = {Traffic flow prediction has always been the focus of research in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems, which is conducive to the more reasonable allocation of basic transportation resources and formulation of transportation policies. The spread of COVID-19 has seriously affected the normal order in the transportation sector. With the increase in the number of infected people and the government's anti-epidemic policy, human outgoing activities have gradually decreased, resulting in increasingly obvious discreteness and irregularities in traffic flow data. This article proposes a deep-space time traffic flow prediction model based on discrete wavelet transform (DSTM-DWT) to overcome the highly discrete and irregular nature of the new crown epidemic. First, DSTM-DWT decomposes traffic flow into discrete attributes, such as flow trend, discrete amplitude, and discrete baseline. Second, we design the spatial relationship of the transportation network as a graph and integrate the new crown pneumonia epidemic data into the characteristics of each transportation node. Then, we use the graph convolutional network to calculate the spatial correlation of each node, and the temporal convolutional network to calculate the temporal correlation of the data. In order to solve the problem of high discreteness of traffic flow data during the epidemic, this article proposes a graph memory network (GMN), which is used to convert discrete magnitudes separated by discrete wavelet transform into high-dimensional discrete features. Finally, use DWT to segment the predicted traffic data, and then perform the inverse discrete wavelet transform between the newly segmented traffic trend and discrete baseline and the discrete model predicted by GMN to obtain the final traffic flow prediction result. In simulation experiments, this work was compared with the existing advanced baselines to verify the superiority of DSTM-DWT.},

	abstract = {Transportation demand forecasting is a critical precondition of optimal online transportation dispatch, which will greatly reduce drivers’ wasted mileage and customers’ waiting time, contributing to economic and environmental sustainability. Though various methods have been developed, the core spatio-temporal complexity remains challenging from three perspectives: (1) Compound spatial relationships. According to our empirical analysis, these relationships widely exist. Previous studies focus on capturing different spatial relationships using multi-homogeneous graphs. However, the information flow across various spatial relationships is not modeled explicitly. (2) Heterogeneity in spatial relationships. A region’s neighbors under the same spatial relationship may have different weights for this region. Meanwhile, different relationships may also weigh differently. (3) Synchronicity between compound spatial relationships and temporal relationships. Previous research considers synchronous influences from spatial and temporal relationships in a homogeneous fashion while compound spatial relationships are not captured for this synchronicity.To address the aforementioned perspectives, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous graph Attention Network (STHAN), where the key intuition is capturing the compound spatial relationships via meta-paths explicitly. We first construct a spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph including multiple spatial relationships and temporal relationships and use meta-paths to depict compound spatial relationships. To capture the heterogeneity, we use hierarchical attention, which contains node level attention and meta-path level attention. The synchronicity between temporal relationships and spatial relationships, including compound ones, is modeled in meta-path-level attention. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models by reducing 6.58\%, 4.57\%, and 4.20\% of WMAPE in experiments on three real-world datasets, respectively.},

However, this task is very challenging given the limited training data, due to the high cost of sensor installment and maintenance across the entire urban space.

In this work, we propose a dynamic multi-view graph neural network for citywide traffic inference with the method CTVI+. Specifically, for the temporal dimension, we propose a temporal self-attention mechanism that is capable of learning the dynamics of traffic data with the time-evolving traffic volume variations. For spatial dimension, we build a multi-view graph neural network, employing the road-wise message passing scheme to capture the region dependencies. With the designed spatial-temporal learning paradigms, we enable our traffic inference model to encode the dynamism from both spatial and temporal traffic patterns, which is reflective of intra- and inter-road traffic correlations. In our evaluation, CTVI+ achieves consistent better performance compared with different baselines on real-world traffic volume datasets. Further ablation study validates the effectiveness of key components in CTVI+. We release the model implementation at https://github.com/dsj96/TKDD.},

It plays a crucial role in traffic management and behavioral analysis, thus it has raised great attention from many researchers. However, predicting crowd flows timely and accurately is a challenging task that is affected by many complex factors such as the dependencies of adjacent regions or recent crowd flows. Existing models mainly focus on capturing such dependencies in spatial or temporal domains and fail to model relations between crowd flows of distant regions. We notice that each region has a relatively fixed daily flow and some regions (even very far away from each other) may share similar flow patterns which show strong correlations among them. In this article, we propose a novel model named Double-Encoder which follows a general encoder–decoder framework for multi-step citywide crowd flow prediction. The model consists of two encoder modules named ST-Encoder and FR-Encoder to model spatial-temporal dependencies and daily flow correlations, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and show that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

However, the model that fits the demand of one transportation by only considering the historical data of its own could be vulnerable since random fluctuations could easily impact the modeling. On the other hand, common factors like time and region attribute, drive the evolution demand of different transportation, leading to a co-evolving intrinsic property between different kinds of transportation. In this work, we focus on exploring the co-evolution between different modes of transport, e.g., taxi demand and shared-bike demand. Two significant challenges impede the discovery of the co-evolving pattern: (1) diversity of the co-evolving correlation, which varies from region to region and time to time. (2) Multi-modal data fusion. Taxi demand and shared-bike demand are time-series data, which have different representations with the external factors. Moreover, the distribution of taxi demand and bike demand are not identical. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method, known as co-evolving spatial temporal neural network (CEST). CEST learns a multi-view demand representation for each mode of transport, extracts the co-evolving pattern, then predicts the demand for the target transportation based on multi-scale representation, which includes fine-scale demand information and coarse-scale pattern information.

	abstract = {Solving the demand prediction problem is an important part of improving the efficiency and reliability of ride-hailing services. Spatial-temporal graph learning methods have shown potential in modeling the spatial-temporal dependencies of ride-hailing demand data, but most existing studies focus on region-level demand prediction with only a few researchers addressing the problem of origin-destination (OD) demand prediction. In addition, previous spatial-temporal graph learning methods employ pre-defined and rigid graph structures that do not reveal the instinct and dynamic dependencies of ride-hailing demand data. In this paper, we propose a joint learning framework called Dynamic Auto-structuring Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) to address the origin-destination demand prediction problem. We develop a Dynamic Graph Decomposition and Recombination layer (DGDR) to handle both the graph structure and the graph representation learning problems simultaneously, with graph representations learned from a group of trainable and time-aware edge-induced subgraphs. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms ten baseline models with two real-world ride-hailing demand datasets and is efficient in structural pattern discovery. Comparing with existing methods, the significant advantage of the proposed method is that it circumvents the difficulties in defining the underlying graph structure of the researched data.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are being increasingly used for short-term traffic flow prediction, which can be generally categorized as convolutional (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs). CNNs are preferable for region-wise traffic prediction by taking advantage of localized spatial correlations, whilst GNNs achieves better performance for graph-structured traffic data. When applied to region-wise traffic prediction, CNNs typically partition an underlying territory into grid-like spatial units, and employ standard convolutions to learn spatial dependence among the units. However, standard convolutions with fixed geometric structures cannot fully model the nonstationary characteristics of local traffic flows. To overcome the deficiency, we introduce deformable convolution that augments the spatial sampling locations with additional offsets, to enhance the modeling capability of spatial nonstationarity. On this basis, we design a deep deformable convolutional residual network, namely DeFlow-Net, that can effectively model global spatial dependence, local spatial nonstationarity, and temporal periodicity of traffic flows. Furthermore, to better fit with convolutions, we suggest to first aggregate traffic flows according to pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions based on traffic flows, then dispose to sequentially organized raster images for network input. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic flows demonstrate that DeFlow-Net outperforms GNNs and existing CNNs using standard convolutions, and spatial partition by pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions further enhances the performance. We also demonstrate the advantage of DeFlow-Net in maintaining spatial autocorrelation, and reveal the impacts of partition shapes and scales on deep traffic flow prediction.},

In this setting, an authority assigns agents to requests such that the average idle time of the agents is minimized. An example is the scheduling of taxis (agents) to meet incoming passenger requests for trips while ensuring that the taxis are empty as little as possible. We address the problem of spatial-temporal demand forecasting and competitive supply (SOUP) in two steps. First, we build a granular model that provides spatial-temporal predictions of requests. Specifically, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Sequential Learning ({\textbackslash}sf ST{\textbackslash}text-GCSLST-GCSL) model that predicts requests across locations and time slots. Second, we provide means of routing agents to request origins while avoiding competition among the agents. In particular, we develop a demand-aware route planning ({\textbackslash}sf DROPDROP) algorithm that considers both the spatial-temporal predictions and the supply-demand state. We report on extensive experiments with real-world data that offer insight into the performance of the solution and show that it is capable of outperforming the state-of-the-art proposals.},

	abstract = {Traffic flow prediction is crucial for public safety and traffic management, and remains a big challenge because of many complicated factors, e.g., multiple spatio-temporal dependencies, holidays, and weather. Some work leveraged 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) to explore spatial relations and temporal relations, respectively, which outperformed the classical approaches. However, it is hard for these work to model spatio-temporal relations jointly. To tackle this, some studies utilized LSTMs to connect high-level layers of CNNs, but left the spatio-temporal correlations not fully exploited in low-level layers. In this work, we propose novel spatio-temporal CNNs to extract spatio-temporal features simultaneously from low-level to high-level layers, and propose a novel gated scheme to control the spatio-temporal features that should be propagated through the hierarchy of layers. Based on these, we propose an end-to-end framework, multiple gated spatio-temporal CNNs (MGSTC), for citywide traffic flow prediction. MGSTC can explore multiple spatio-temporal dependencies through multiple gated spatio-temporal CNN branches, and combine the spatio-temporal features with external factors dynamically. Extensive experiments on two real traffic datasets demonstrates that MGSTC outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Ride-hailing applications have been offering convenient ride services for people in need. However, such applications still suffer from the issue of supply-demand disequilibrium, which is a typical problem for traditional taxi services. With effective predictions on passenger demands, we can alleviate the disequilibrium by pre-dispatching, dynamic pricing or avoiding dispatching cars to zero-demand areas. Existing studies of demand predictions mainly utilize limited data sources, trajectory data, or orders of ride services or both of them, which also lacks a multi-perspective consideration. In this article, we present a unified framework with a new combined model and a road-network-based spatial partition to leverage multi-source data and model the passenger demands from temporal, spatial, and zero-demand-area perspectives. In addition, our framework realizes offline training and online predicting, which can satisfy the real-time requirement more easily. We analyze and evaluate the performance of our combined model using the actual operational data from UCAR. The experimental results indicate that our model outperforms baselines on both Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error on average.},

Recent advance in mobile traffic analysis has fostered understanding of city functions. In this article, we propose FlowFlexDP, a demand prediction model that integrates regional crowd flow and applies to flexible region partition. Analysis on a cellular dataset covering 1.5 million users in a major city in China reveals strong correlation between passenger demand and crowd flow. FlowFlexDP extracts both order history and crowd flow from cellular data, and adopts Graph Convolutional Neural Network to adapt prediction for regions of arbitrary shapes and sizes in a city. Evaluation on a large scale data set of 6 online car-hailing applications from cellular data shows that FlowFlexDP accurately predicts passenger demand and outperforms the state-of-the-art demand prediction methods.},

To cope with the fact that existing approaches do not adapt to variation in traffic, we show how this novel approach allows advanced modelling by integrating into the forecasting of flow, the impact of the various events that CV realistically encountered on segments along their trajectory. We solve the STP problem with a Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in a multitask learning setting augmented by input from CV. Results show that our approach, namely MTL-CV, with an average Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of 0.052, outperforms state-of-the-art ARIMA time series (RMSE of 0.255) and baseline classifiers (RMSE of 0.122). Compared to single task learning with artificial neural network (ANN), ANN had a lower performance, 0.113 for RMSE, than MTL-CV. MTL-CV learned historical similarities between segments, in contrast to using direct historical trends in the measure, because trends may not exist in the measure but do in the similarities.},

However, most existing techniques focus solely on forecasting entrance and exit flows of metro stations that do not provide enough useful knowledge for traffic management. In practical applications, managers desperately want to solve the problem of getting the potential passenger distributions to help authorities improve transport services, termed as crowd flow distribution (CFD) forecasts. Therefore, to improve the quality of transportation services, we proposed three spatiotemporal models to effectively address the network-wide CFD prediction problem based on the online latent space (OLS) strategy. Our models take into account the various trending patterns and climate influences, as well as the inherent similarities among different stations that are able to predict both CFD and entrance and exit flows precisely. In our online systems, a sequence of CFD snapshots is used as the training data. The latent attribute evolutions of different metro stations can be learned from the previous trend and do the next prediction based on the transition patterns. All the empirical results demonstrate that the three developed models outperform all the other state-of-the-art approaches on three large-scale real-world datasets.},

Although many prior researches have struggled for accurate prediction results, most of them achieve inferior performance due to insufficient feature extraction of travel speed and road network structure from the trajectory data, which confirms the challenges involved in this topic. To overcome those issues, we propose a novel neural Network for Travel Time Prediction based on tensor decomposition and graph embedding, named TTPNet, which can extract travel speed and representation of road network structure effectively from historical trajectories, as well as predict the travel time with better accuracy. Specifically, TTPNet consists of three components: the first module (Travel Speed Features Layer) leverages non-negative tensor decomposition to restore travel speed distributions on different roads in the previous hour, and integrates a CNN-RNN model to extract both long-term and short-term travel speed features of the query trajectory; the second module (Road Network Structure Features Layer) utilizes graph embedding to generate the representation of local and global road network structure; the last module (Deep LSTM Prediction Layer) completes the final predicting task. Empirical results over two real-world large-scale datasets show that our proposed TTPNet model can achieve significantly better performance and remarkable robustness.},

Prior works have focused on predicting next-step passenger demands at selected locations or hotspots. However, we argue that multi-step citywide passenger demands encapsulate both time-varying demand trends and global statuses, and hence are more beneficial to avoiding demand-service mismatching and developing effective vehicle distribution/scheduling strategies. Furthermore, we find that adaptations of single-step methods are unable to achieve robust prediction with high accuracy for further steps. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network model to the prediction task. We employ an encoder-decoder framework based on convolutional and ConvLSTM units to identify complex features that capture spatiotemporal influence and pickup-dropoff interactions on citywide passenger demands. We introduce a multi-level attention model (global attention and temporal attention) to emphasize the effects of latent citywide mobility regularities and capture relevant temporal dependencies. We evaluate our proposed method using real-world mobility trips (taxis and bikes) and the experimental results show that our method achieves higher prediction accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches.},
