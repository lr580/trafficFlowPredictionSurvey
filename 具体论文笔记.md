T-ZS25 总结：

为了获取不规则路网的空间信息，并且避免ＲＮＮ体系多次迭代引起的误差积累。主体由２个时空卷积块堆叠组成，每个时空卷积块通过２个门控时间卷积和一个空间图卷积构成“三明治”结构，其中空间卷积层通过谱域图卷积提取空间信息，时间卷积层采用ＧＲＵ实现的一维因果卷积学习时间依赖性。在城市交通系统运行时，早晚高峰会引起强烈的交通流数据波动，而循环神经网络体系由于依赖上一步记忆的信息而无法捕捉到这种剧烈的数据变化。ＳＴＧＣＮ方法采用门控卷积层实时提取交通流时间轴上的动态行为，不受之前时间点预测数据的限制，并且由于时序和空间提取层都采用了卷积的结构，可以通过堆叠的方式并行训练，取得了更短的训练时间。ＳＴＧＣＮ方法首次使用纯卷积层同时提取时间和空间信息，并且由于纯卷积操作相较于ＲＮＮ结构大幅提升了训练速度，可以有效应用于大尺度的数据集

T-ZS28 首次应用纯卷积架构,从基于交通图时间序列中同时提取时空特征,通过真实数据集的验证,表明该架构比基于RNN的图时空网络的训练速度快10倍以上,而且训练的参数更少。然而,在处理时间序列问题的实践中,CNN模型不如RNN模型常见,因为CNN模型缺乏对长时间序列的记忆

T-ZS37 由于同时包含有图卷积和门控时间卷积，ＳＴＧＣＮ模型可以在提取空间特征的同时，有效地捕获时间特征．由于ＳＴＧＣＮ模型完全由ＣＮＮ组成，因此其训练速度明显优于基于ＲＮＮ的时空图卷积模型

Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Traffic Forecasting

##### 模型

空间：GCN 改进

时间：GRU

we propose two adaptive modules for enhancing Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with new capabilities: 1) a Node Adaptive Parameter Learning (NAPL) module to capture node-specific patterns; 2) a Data Adaptive Graph Generation (DAGG) module to infer the inter-dependencies among different traffic series automatically. We further propose an Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (AGCRN) to capture fine-grained spatial and temporal correlations in traffic series automatically based on the two modules and recurrent networks.

- a Node Adaptive Parameter Learning (NAPL) module to learn node-specific patterns for each traffic series—NAPL factorizes the parameters in traditional GCN and generates node-specific parameters from a weights pool and bias pool shared by all nodes according to the node embedding
- a Data Adaptive Graph Generation (DAGG) module to infer the node embedding (attributes) from data and to generate the graph during training. NAPL and DAGG are independent and can be adapted to existing GCN-based traffic forecasting models both separately and jointly
- we combine NAPL and DAGG with recurrent networks and propose a unified traffic forecasting model - Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (AGCRN). AGCRN can capture fine-grained node-specific spatial and temporal correlations in the traffic series and unify the nodes embeddings in the revised GCNs with the embedding in DAGG

##### 模型

空间：图卷积

时间：1D CNN

Our approach automatically extracts the uni-directed relations among variables through a graph learning module, into which external knowledge like variable attributes can be easily integrated. A novel mix-hop propagation layer and a dilated inception layer are further proposed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies within the time series. The graph learning, graph convolution, and temporal convolution modules are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework.

- we propose a novel graph learning layer, which extracts a sparse graph adjacency matrix adaptively based on data. Furthermore, we develop a graph convolution module to address the spatial dependencies among variables, given the adjacency matrix computed by the graph learning layer. This is designed specifically for directed graphs and avoids the over-smoothing problem that frequently occurs in graph convolutional networks
- Finally, we propose a temporal convolution module to capture temporal patterns by modified 1D convolutions. It can both discover temporal patterns with multiple frequencies and process very long sequences.

In this paper, we propose a novel attention based spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN) model to solve traffic flow forecasting problem

- ASTGCN mainly consists of three independent components to respectively model three temporal properties of traffic flows, i.e., recent, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic dependencies.

- each component contains two major parts: 

  \1 the spatial-temporal attention mechanism to effectively capture the dynamic spatialtemporal correlations in traffic data; 

  \2 the spatial-temporal convolution which simultaneously employs graph convolutions to capture the spatial patterns and common standard convolutions to describe the temporal features

- The output of the three components are weighted fused to generate the final prediction results

In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal factors, and propose a graph multi-attention network (GMAN) to predict traffic conditions for time steps ahead at different locations on a road network graph. GMAN adapts an encoder-decoder architecture, where both the encoder and the decoder consist of multiple spatio-temporal attention blocks to model the impact of the spatio-temporal factors on traffic conditions. The encoder encodes the input traffic features and the decoder predicts the output sequence. Between the encoder and the decoder, a transform attention layer is applied to convert the encoded traffic features to generate the sequence representations of future time steps as the input of the decoder. The transform attention mechanism models the direct relationships between historical and future time steps that helps to alleviate the error propagation problem among prediction time steps

- he STSGCN model can simultaneously capture the localized spatial-temporal correlations directly, instead of using different types of deep neural networks to model the spatial dependencies and temporal correlations separately. Specifically, we construct localized spatial-temporal graphs which connect individual spatial graphs of adjacent time steps into one graph
- Then we construct a Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional Module (STSGCM) to capture the complex localized spatial-temporal correlations in these localized spatial-temporal graphs
- Meanwhile, to capture the heterogeneity in long-range spatial-temporal network data, we design a Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional Layer (STSGCL), which deploys multiple individual STSGCMs on different time periods. Finally, we stack multiple STSGCLs to aggregate long-range spatial-temporal correlations and heterogeneity for prediction.

思想：把时间依赖也做成图，解决时空依赖

To overcome those limitations, our paper proposes a novel Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Networks (STFGNN) for traffic flow forecasting

- First, a data-driven method of generating “temporal graph” is proposed to compensate several existing correlations that spatial graph may not reflect
- SFTGNN could effectively learn hidden spatial-temporal dependencies by a novel fusion operation of various spatial and temporal graphs, treated for different time periods in parallel
- Meanwhile, by integrating this fusion graph module and a novel gated convolution module into a unified layer, SFTGNN could handle long sequences by learning more spatial-temporal dependencies with layers stacked

<img src="img/image-20240819234537669.png" alt="image-20240819234537669" style="zoom: 67%;" />

we propose a novel data-driven method for graph construction: the temporal graph learned based on similarities between time series. Then several graphs could be integrated as a spatial-temporal fusion graph to obtain hidden spatial-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to break the local and global correlation tradeoff, gated dilated convolution module is introduced, whose larger dilation rate could capture long-range dependencies

- We construct a novel graph by a data-driven method, which preserve hidden spatial-temporal dependencies. This data-driven adjacency matrix is able to extract correlations that given spatial graph may not present. Then, we propose a novel spatial-temporal fusion graph module to capture spatial-temporal dependencies synchronously.
- We propose an effective framework to capture local and global correlations simultaneously, by assembling a Gated dilated CNN module with spatial-temporal fusion graph module in parallel. Long-range spatial-temporal dependencies could also be extracted with layers stacked

现有的交通图构建常依赖于指定区域节点间的空间邻近关系，而忽略了不同节点在时间上的相似性，例如早高峰时期不同区域的商业区、学校同样会出现交通拥堵问题，但是这些区域因为在空间上的距离较远，往往在交通图的构建中被忽略了。为此，研究者开始探索使用不同方式进行交通图的构建。时空融合图神经网络使用动态时间规整（Ｄｙｎａｍｉｃ　Ｔｉｍｅ　Ｗａｒｐｉｎｇ，ＤＴＷ）的方法计算节点时间序列的相似度，在传统的空间图的基础上，动态地构建时间图，通过融合时间和空间图提取隐藏的时空特性，再使用门控扩散卷积捕获全局和局部的相关性，通过堆叠处理可以更好地学习时空依赖性以及处理长序列的时空相关性

To tackle this problem, we design a novel multi-scale architecture, Spatio-Temporal U-Net (ST-UNet), for graph-structured time series modeling. In this U-shaped network, a paired sampling operation is proposed in spacetime domain accordingly: the pooling (ST-Pool) coarsens the input graph in spatial from its deterministic partition while abstracts multi-resolution temporal dependencies through dilated recurrent skip connections; based on previous settings in the downsampling

- ST-UNet employs multi-granularity graph convolution for extracting both generalized and localized spatial features, 

  and adds dilated recurrent skip-connections for capturing multi-resolution temporal dependencies

We trained the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN model to forecast both speed and flow simultaneously

We evaluated our approach on the California highway network. We used data from PeMS [50], which provides access to real-time and historical performance data from over 39,000 individual sensors. The individual sensors placed on the different highways are aggregated across several lanes and are fed into vehicle detector stations. Vehicle detector stations include a variety of sensors such as inductive loops, radar, and magnetometers. The sensors may be located on high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, mainlines, on-ramps, and off-ramps. The dataset covers 9 districts of California—D3 (North Central) with 1,212 stations, D4 (Bay Area) with 3,880 stations, D5 (Central coast) with 382 stations, D6 (South Central) with 624 stations, D7 (Los Angeles) with 4,864 stations, D8 (San Bernardino) with 2,115 stations, D10 (Central) with 1,195 stations, D11 (San Diego) with 1,502 stations, and D12 (Orange County) with 2,539 stations—giving a total of 18,313 stations listed by location. Detectors capture samples every 30 seconds. PeMS then aggregates that data to the granularity of 5 minutes, an hour, and a day. The data include timestamp, station ID, district, freeway, direction of travel, total flow, and average speed (mph). 

PeMS does not list the latitude and longitude for the stations IDs, which are essential for defining the connectivity matrix used by DCRNN. Instead, the latitude and longitude are associated with postmile markers of every freeway given the direction. We found the latitude and longitude for sensor IDs by matching the absolute postmile markers of every freeway. Linear interpolation was used to find the exact latitude and longitude if the absolute postmile markers did not match exactly. 

The official PeMS website shows that 69.59% of the ≈18K stations are in good working condition. The remaining 30.41% do not capture time series data throughout the year and therefore were excluded from our dataset. Our final dataset has speed and flow of 11,160 stations from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, with a granularity of every 5 minutes. 

We observed that flow and speed values are missing for multiple time periods in the time series data. The percentage of missing data is small—for speed 0.06% (698,162 out of 1,173,139,200 data points) and for flow 0.04% (504,688 out of 1,173,139,200 data points). We explored three different imputation techniques—temporal mean, temporal median, and linear interpolation—and did not find significant difference because the percentage of missing data is less than 1%. The details of the experiments and results are reported in the Supporting experiments, Missing data imputation. Therefore, we replaced the missing data by the temporal mean

引入新的损失函数

We introduce a novel loss function, Covariance Loss, which is conceptually equivalent to conditional neural processes and has a form of regularization so that is applicable to many kinds of neural networks. With the proposed loss, mappings from input variables to target variables are highly affected by dependencies of target variables as well as mean activation and mean dependencies of input and target variables. This nature enables the resulting neural networks to become more robust to noisy observations and recapture missing dependencies from prior information.

使用了 STGCN 和 Graph WaveNet 做改进

To demonstrate the validity of the proposed Covariance Loss, we employ neural networks that are designed to explicitly consider the spatial and temporal dependencies, namely, spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) and graph wavenet (GWNET)

In this work, we propose a novel approach for traffic prediction that embeds time-varying dynamic Bayesian network to capture the fine spatiotemporal topology of traffic data. 

We then use graph convolutional networks to generate traffic forecasts. 

To enable our method to efficiently model nonlinear traffic propagation patterns, we develop a deep learning-based module as a hyper-network to generate stepwise dynamic causal graphs

- we propose a novel causal-embedded approach for traffic prediction. It represents the spatiotemporal traffic network topology using a time-varying DBN (TVDBN), which is designed to adapt to the time-varying traffic propagation patterns by learning DBNs step by step
- The learned TVDBN is able to summarize the dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies between nodes. Built upon it, graph convolution is applied to capture spatial dependencies for traffic prediction.
- We propose a complete deep learning based causal structure learning module that serves as a pretrained hyper-network to generate the graphs of the TVDBN.
- The predefined distance graph is further incorporated into graph generator and traffic prediction module as additional prior information to improve the performance.
- We propose an approach based on GCN and RNN to learn a TVDBN that describes the time-varying causal relationships between different locations in traffic network. The augmented Lagrange method is applied for model training to ensure the acyclicity of the TVDBN

Different from existing models, STAWnet does not need prior knowledge of the graph by developing a self-learned node embedding. These components are integrated into an end-to-end framework.

The graph diffusion attention module can adjust its weights by learning from data like a CNN to capture more realistic spatial dependencies. The temporal attention module captures the temporal correlations

- Random GATs discard traditional attention interaction (e.g., dot product) and instead, use a learnable matrix to discover the correlations between neighbors. This method omits the process of dot-product interaction in ordinary attention, reduces the time complexity, improves the computational speed of the model, and reduces the memory overhead
- Random Graph Diffusion Attention Network (RGDAN), consists of an attention mechanism with a graph diffusion attention module that extracts the spatial correlations. Temporal attention captures the temporal dependencies. The temporal and spatial features are fused by a gated fusion layer. The transformed attention module is used to alleviate the propagation error caused by the difference between the predicted and historical time steps

- In DGCRN, hyper-networks are designed to leverage and extract dynamic characteristics from node attributes, while the parameters of dynamic filters are generated at each time step. We filter the node embeddings and then use them to generate dynamic graph, which is integrated with pre-defined static graph

to improve modeling performance, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal F ramework (DSTF) that separates the diffusion and inherent traffic information in a data-driven manner, which encompasses a unique estimation gate and a residual decomposition mechanism

- The former (residual) removes the parts of signals that the diffusion and inherent models can approximate well. Thus, the parts of signals that are not learned well is retained. 
- The latter (gate) estimates roughly the proportion of the two kinds of signals to relieve the burden of the first model in each layer, which takes the original signal as input and needs to learn specific parts in it

we propose an instantiation of DSTF, Decoupled Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (D2STGNN), that captures spatial-temporal correlations and also features a dynamic graph learning module that targets the learning of the dynamic characteristics of traffic networks

- spatial dependency by learning latent correlations between time series based on the self-attention mechanism.
- A spatial-temporal localized convolution is designed to model the hidden diffusion time series. A recurrent neural network and self-attention mechanism are used jointly to model the hidden inherent time series.

we propose a Spatio-Temporal Graph Mixformer (STGM) network, a highly optimized model with low memory footprint. We address the aforementioned limits by utilizing a novel attention mechanism to capture the correlation between temporal and spatial dependencies. Specifically, we use convolution layers with a variable fields of view for each head to capture long–short term temporal dependency. Additionally, we train an estimator model that express the contribution of a node over the desired prediction. The estimation is fed alongside a distance matrix to the attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we use a gated mechanism and a mixer layer to further select and incorporate the different perspectives.

- We suggest a similarity estimator model that given a set of nodes with a segment of historical traffic, approximates the expected implication of each node over the future traffic signal. 
- Furthermore, we designed a couple of improvements for the original transformer architecture named STGA that fully utilizes the multi-head attention and seamlessly capture both temporal and spatial dependencies. 
- We propose the CT-Mixer module that works in coordination with STGA to further capture the temporal locality and internode channels information

Spatial-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential Equation Networks

Specifically, we capture spatial-temporal dynamics through a tensor-based ordinary differential equation (ODE), as a result, deeper networks can be constructed and spatial-temporal features are utilized synchronously

To understand the network more comprehensively, semantical adjacency matrix is considered in our model, and a well-design temporal dilated convolution structure is used to capture long term temporal dependencies

- First, in order to depict spatial correlations from both geographical and semantic views, we construct two types of adjacency matrices, i.e. spatial adjacency matrix and semantic adjacency matrix, based on spatial connectivity and semantical similarity of traffic flow respectively

- residual connections are added between layers to alleviate the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, it is proved that the discrete layers with residual connections can be viewed as a discretization of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)

- and so a continuous graph neural network (CGNN) is derived

  a continuous GNN with residual connections is introduced to avoid the over-smoothing problem and hence be able to model long-range spatial-temporal dependencies. Last but not least, a spatial-temporal tensor is constructed to consider spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously and model complex spatial-temporal interactions

we aim to provide a novel disentangle-fusion framework STWave to mitigate the distribution shift issue. The framework first decouples the complex traffic data into stable trends and fluctuating events, followed by a dual-channel spatio-temporal network to model trends and events, respectively

Finally, reasonable future traffic can be predicted through the fusion of trends and events. Besides, we incorporate a novel query sampling strategy and graph wavelet-based graph positional encoding into the full graph attention network to efficiently and effectively model dynamic spatial correlations

The end-to-end and our proposed disentangle-fusion traffic forecasting framework, where STNet denotes the spatiotemporal network.

- a dual-channel spatio-temporal network to capture the dualscale temporal changes and spatial correlations.

- Following this principle, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework named STWave, which first applies the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to disentangle the traffic time series into the dual-scale trend-event representations because DWT can decompose data into various components, such as the main information (i.e., trend information) and details (i.e., event information)

- STNet that utilizes corresponding sequential and graph-based methods on the different information to capture the various temporal changes and spatial correlations

  the causal convolution with small kernel size, temporal attention with the global temporal receptive field, and the state-of-the-art full GAT are adopted on events, trends, and both of them to capture fluctuating temporal changes, stable temporal changes, and different temporal changes-based dynamic global spatial correlations, respectively

- Moreover, to address the high complexity and insufficient structure information in the full GAT, a novel query sampling strategy and a novel graph wavelet-based graph positional encoding are proposed in STWave. The query sampling strategy reduces the complexity while maintaining the global receptive field according to the hierarchical nature of the traffic system

  and the graph wavelet-based graph positional encoding brings the local-global balanced structure information based on the spectral graph theory

- Finally, an adaptive event fusion module is used in STWave to merge useful information from inaccurate forecast events into easily predict trends

DDGCRN combines a dynamic graph convolution recurrent network with an RNN-based model that generates dynamic graphs based on time-varying traffic signals, allowing for the extraction of both spatial and temporal features. Additionally, DDGCRN separates abnormal signals from normal traffic signals and models them using a data-driven approach to further improve predictions

- Here, temporal information corresponding to the traffic signal is combined with the spatial embedding to generate a spatio-temporal embedding. Then, a dynamic graph embedding is combined with dynamic signals extracted from the traffic signals to produce a dynamic graph. This method fully considers the periodicity and dynamics of the traffic signals so that the generated dynamic graph captures the most realistic correlations between nodes. Lastly, the spatio-temporal dependencies in the traffic signals are extracted via the Dynamic Graph Convolution Recurrent Module (DGCRM), which is based on an RNN

we have proposed a novel hybrid time-varying graph neural network (HTVGNN) for traffic flow prediction. 

Firstly, a novel enhanced temporal perception multi-head self-attention mechanism based on time-varying mask enhancement was reported to more accurately model the dynamic temporal dependencies among distinct traffic nodes in the traffic network

Secondly, we have proposed a novel graph learning strategy to concurrently learn both static and dynamic spatial associations between different traffic nodes in road networks. Meanwhile, in order to enhance the learning ability of time-varying graphs, a coupled graph learning mechanism was designed to couple the graphs learned at each time step

Furthermore, we proposed a dynamic graph convolution approach, which utilized a combined topology and semantic matrix as a mask, enabling more precise modeling of the dynamic spatial correlations in traffic networks

- A novel temporal perception multi-head self-attention mechanism enhanced by a time-varying mask, diverging from traditional approaches is proposed. This mechanism dynamically adjusts attention calculations based on the temporal characteristics of input data, enabling more accurate capture of temporal dependencies among traffic nodes. The time-varying mask consists of three components: a static mask embedding for correcting the multi-head self-attention mechanism, and two dynamic mask embeddings to augment the time-awareness of the mechanism

Correlated time series (CTS)

On this basis, we propose the LightCTS framework that adopts plain stacking of temporal and spatial operators instead of alternate stacking that is much more computationally expensive. Moreover, LightCTS features light temporal and spatial operator modules, called L-TCN and GL-Former, that offer improved computational efficiency without compromising their feature extraction capabilities. LightCTS also encompasses a last-shot compression scheme to reduce redundant temporal features and speed up subsequent computations

By following these directions, LightCTS offers a set of novel lightweight techniques. First, LightCTS includes a novel T-operator module called Light Temporal Convolutional Network (L-TCN) and a novel S-operator module called GlobalLocal TransFormer (GL-Former) for temporal and spatial feature extraction,

时空：GNN

we propose a novel deep learning framework to overcome these issues: 3D Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (3D-TGCN). Two novel components of our model are introduced. (1) Instead of constructing the road graph based on spatial information, we learn it by comparing the similarity between time series for each road, thus providing a spatial information free framework. (2) We propose an original 3D graph convolution model to model the spatio-temporal data more accurately

we propose a 3D graph convolution network where 3D convolution is applied to simultaneously learn the spatial and temporal patterns together.

Furthermore, we offer a spatial information free approach for constructing the graph for traffic network, purely relying on the similarity of time series for each road. This new proposal could capture more effective patterns between different roads than the spatial graph, facilitating superior prediction performance.

- To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the adversarial domain adaption is used in traffic forecasting to effectively learn the transferable knowledge in multiple cities.

propose a novel transferable traffic forecasting framework: Domain Adversarial Spatial-Temporal Network (DastNet). DastNet is pre-trained on multiple source networks and fine-tuned with the target network’s traffic data. Specifically, we leverage the graph representation learning and adversarial domain adaptation techniques to learn the domain-invariant node embeddings, which are further incorporated to model the temporal traffic data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ adversarial multi-domain adaptation for network-wide traffic forecasting problems.

we propose a factorized Spatial-Temporal Tensor Graph Convolutional Network to deal with traffic speed prediction. Traffic networks are modeled and unified into a graph that integrates spatial and temporal information simultaneously. We further extend graph convolution into tensor space and propose a tensor graph convolution network to extract more discriminating features from spatial-temporal graph data. To reduce the computational burden, we take Tucker tensor decomposition and derive factorized a tensor convolution, which performs separate filtering in small-scale space, time, and feature modes. Besides, we can benefit from noise suppression of traffic data when discarding those trivial components in the process of tensor decomposition

The data obtained from the traffic management platform ofBeijing are used to test the proposed DeepEnsemble approach.The traffic data are collected by inductive loop detectorsinstalled on the ring roads and radial expressways in Bei-jing, China. The segment-wise average speed is obtained byaveraging raw measured speed weighted by lane flows andthen aggregated into a 10-min time interval. Each loop detec-tor provides 144 data points each day. There are some ran-domly missing speed data in some detectors, with a missingrate of 0.38%, and we impute the missing speed data of those detectors using the mean value of the previous three steps.In this paper, we obtain the three-month data collected from308 detectors, between July 1, 2015, and September 30, 2015.Divide the data into training set and test set according to 2:1.The input traffic speed data for both the training and test setsare normalized before feeding into the model.

Urban rail transit passenger flow forecast based on LSTM with enhanced long-term features

##### 数据

重庆

the smart card data of 126 stations from 1 January 2014 to 30 March2015 are provided by Chongqing Transport Planning and Research Institute, with the fields involving card ID, station code, date, and heading (Entrance or Exit). According to the privacy protection ordinance, personal information about cardholders has been masked. To obtain more reliable results, incomplete and invalid records are filtered. The inter-station passenger flow for per hour of the day is denoted by hour_OD. Each pair of stations contains 8772 od records. Hence, a total of 1,3926,4272 (126 × 126 × 8772) records are acquired and stored in the MongoDB database. The hour_OD is an array with the length of 24. Subsequently, the number of passengers per hour from station a to station b on day d (w is the day of the week) can be described

A CNN-LSTM Model for Traffic Speed Prediction

##### 数据

The Transport Department of Hong Kong provides real-time and historical average traffic speed of major roads in Hong Kong every five minutes [18]. We use all the data available (from 2016/11/25 to 2019/10/25) and the average speed in the Cross-Harbour Tunnel at 19:30 as the true value for prediction (we also tried other times and similar results were observed). From Fig. 4 we can clearly see that, different days of a week have significantly different averages and standard deviations of speed. The highest average and standard deviation of speed is on Sunday and the lowest is on Friday. Although Monday and Tuesday have a similar average speed, Tuesday has a smaller standard deviation of speed. Therefore, such data is feasible to be separated by different days of a week.

The collected data are then aggregated into a 5-min or 1-hour interval for each vehicle detection station (VDS) and stored in the online database. The particular VDS we look at in this paper has ID 1201100, and locates at lane 2 of I-405 mainline at Irvine Center Drive. One-month data (from August 1st to Agust 31th 2014) are selected in our experiments

Since weekday and weekend traffic present different patterns, here we only analyze the weekday traffic flow. A common issue with the collected data by roadside detector is data fidelity. Sometimes the detector is not working in normal condition, and the data has to be imputed by recalculation using neighbor roads information. PeMS provides its own test on the data and shows the percentage of data that is observed or imputed. In this paper, the data used has a imputation value of 0%, thus the reliability of the experiments is ensured

A Multi-Task Matrix Factorized Graph Neural Network for Co-Prediction of Zone-Based and OD-Based Ride-Hailing Demand

##### 数据

We implement experiments on two ride-hailing dataset. The first one is a for-hire-vehicle dataset released by [New York TLC in September 2018](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The dataset is built on data reported by ride-hailing company like Uber and Lyft, including trip-specific information such as pick-up and dropoff time, origin and destination. The origin and destination of each raw trip record are provided in the form of TLC zone id, which is determined based on zip code. The partition method for Manhattan by TLC is exactly as shown in Fig. 1b. In this experiment, we mainly focus on trips with more than one customers sharing a single vehicle, called shared service mode. Only orders with non-empty records of timestamp, origin and destination will be counted. After filtering, the dataset contains a total of 18970027 OD transactions

In addition to ride-hailing dataset with OD record, we also employ the Smart Location Database to collect properties including distance between regions, and zone-specific information like residences number, employment rate and other point of interest. With the combination of the two datasets, we then construct the two correlation matrices

Demand patterns may be stable in mega-city like New York. However, in other tourism areas, the pattern may change a lot across seasons. To validate the robustness, we also test our method on a dataset released by DiDi Chuxing for Haikou, a tourism city in southern China. The dataset we used [src](https://gaia.didichuxing.com/) contains ride-hailing trips for five month since June 2017. The Haikou city is first partitioned into 10 × 10 rectangular grids which contains basically all the recorded OD data. Some grids with rare data records are then deleted, leaving 59 grids which include most of the historical OD trips. The remaining grid network is naturally classified into non-Euclidean domain. All the OD transactions considered are then processed to contain zone-based origin and destination information, as well as the corresponding time stamps. Similar process of filtering as done on the Manhattan dataset is then implemented for Haikou data. Correlation matrices and semantic adjacency matrices are also constructed. In addition, our method follows a routine of using both tendency and periodicity features for predictions (introduced later in the following paragraphs), while no specific module is added to characterize the seasonal patterns. Instead, these patterns are learned by training on a sufficiently long horizon such that the model can experience many scenarios, including the scenarios with suddenly changing demand over weeks.

Ising-Traffic: Using Ising Machine Learning to Predict Traffic Congestion under Uncertainty

In particular, Ising-Traffic formulates traffic prediction under uncertainty into two Ising models: Reconstruct-Ising and Predict-Ising. Reconstruct-Ising is mapped onto modern Ising machines and handles uncertainty in traffic accurately with negligible latency and energy consumption, while Predict-Ising is mapped onto traditional processors and predicts future congestion precisely with only at most 1.8% computational demands of existing solutions.

Ising 介绍：

The Ising model is a foundation for describing statistical physics systems of correlated binary spin variables $\sigma_i\in\{\pm 1\}^N_{i=1}$ up to quadratic interactions. Formally, an Ising model of N spins is an exponential family model for binary N -spin data $s\equiv\{\sigma_1,\cdots,\sigma_N\}\in\{\pm 1\}^N$ up to quadratic sufficient statistic taking the Boltzmann form ……

> GPT：
>
> **Ising模型** 是统计物理学中用于研究**相变和临界现象**的一个数学模型，最初由德国物理学家**恩斯特·伊辛**（Ernst Ising）于1925年提出。这个模型主要用于描述**磁性材料中的自发磁化现象**，即在某些温度以下，材料能够表现出永久磁性。
>
> ### 模型基本概念
>
> Ising模型假设一个系统由许多称为**自旋**的单元组成，这些自旋可以位于一个二维或三维的晶格上。每个自旋只有两个可能的取值：

> - **-1**：表示“向下”自旋。
>
> 自旋之间存在相互作用，最简单的情况下：
>
> - **相邻自旋**之间的相互作用倾向于使它们保持相同的方向（相同的自旋状态）。
> - 系统还受**外部磁场**的影响，这会倾向于使所有自旋向某个方向排列。
>
> ### Ising模型的哈密顿量
>
> 系统的能量可以通过一个数学函数（**哈密顿量**）来描述： 
> $$
> H=-J\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle}s_is_j-h\sum_is_i

> 其中：
>
> - $s_i$ 是第 i 个自旋的取值（+1 或 -1）。
> - J 是相邻自旋之间的耦合常数（通常假设 J>0，表示相邻自旋倾向于相同的方向）。
> - ⟨i,j⟩ 表示相邻自旋对。
> - h 是外部磁场的强度。
> - 第一个求和项表示所有相邻自旋之间的相互作用，第二个求和项表示外部磁场对每个自旋的作用。
>
> ### 相变与临界温度
>
> Ising模型是研究相变（如铁磁-顺磁相变）的典型模型。在高温下，自旋会随机取值，系统表现为**顺磁性**；在低温下，自旋倾向于排列整齐，表现出**铁磁性**。模型的一个重要特性是，它展示了在某一临界温度（**居里温度**）下的**相变现象**。
>
> ### Ising模型的应用
>
> 尽管 Ising 模型最初是为了研究磁性材料而提出的，它已经在各种其他领域得到了广泛应用，如：
>
> - **生物物理学**（如蛋白质折叠问题）
> - **社会网络**（如意见传播模型）
> - **计算机科学**（如优化问题）
>
> Ising 模型因其简单性和可解析性，尤其是在二维无外场的情况下，可以通过严格数学方法求解（如**Onsager解**），因此成为统计力学中的一个经典模型。

Specifically, the memory system includes three components: access interface, memory module, and feedback interface. The access interface based on the attention mechanism and the feedback interface based on the gate mechanism are used to guide the model to extract useful patterns and integrate these patterns into the model to enhance spatiotemporal representation respectively. The memory module is used to learn specific knowledge-based patterns, and this is achieved by constraining the learning process with unsupervised loss functions formulated inspired by exogenous knowledge.

Spatio-Temporal Aware Window Attention ST-WA

we propose a framework that aims at turning spatio-temporal agnostic models to spatio-temporal aware models. To do so, we encode time series from different locations into stochastic variables, from which we generate location-specific and time-varying model parameters to better capture the spatio-temporal dynamics. We show how to integrate the framework with canonical attentions to enable spatio-temporal aware attentions. Next, to compensate for the additional overhead introduced by the spatio-temporal aware model parameter generation process, we propose a novel window attention scheme, which helps reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear, making spatio-temporal aware attentions also have competitive efficiency.

We also develop two strategies to incur the spatial information into the dependency relation embedding between multiple historical time steps and the current one in MSDR. On the basis of it, we propose the Graph-based MSDR (GMSDR) framework to support general spatial temporal forecasting applications by seamlessly integrating graph-based neural networks with MSDR

As the dataset includes the timestamps of the individual trip information, we vary the temporal resolution (5min, 15min, and 60min intervals) to test our model performance. In addition to the full O-D matrix (67 × 67), we also sample 10 × 10 small O-D pair samples to align with the CDP dataset

Mining Spatio-Temporal Relations via Self-Paced Graph Contrastive Learning

#### 阅读笔记

##### 模型

we propose a novel adaptive graph construction strategy: Self-Paced Graph Contrastive Learning (SPGCL). It learns informative relations by maximizing the distinguishing margin between positive and negative neighbors and generates an optimal graph with a self-paced strategy. Specifically, the existing neighborhoods iteratively absorb more reliable nodes with the highest affinity scores as new neighbors to generate the next-round neighborhoods, and augmentations are applied to improve the transferability and robustness. As the adaptively self-paced graph approaches the optimized graph for prediction, the mutual information between nodes and the corresponding neighbors is maximized. Our work provides a new perspective of addressing spatio-temporal learning problems beyond information aggregation in Euclidean space and can be generalized to different tasks

We train the feature network with node- and edge-level domain adaptation techniques to learn generalizable spatial features for both source and target cities. We further train the weighting network via source-target joint meta-learning such that source regions helpful to target finetuning are assigned high weights. Finally, the prediction model is selectively trained on the source city with the learned weights to initialize target fine-tuning

We further design a novel model learning objective with metrics that capture both the mobility distributions and the socio-economic factors, ensuring spatial fairness in the communities’ resource accessibility and their experienced DES prediction accuracy. Through its integration with the optimization regularizer, EIGDES jointly learns the DES flow patterns and socio-economic factors, and returns socially-equitable flow predictions

we present a Spatio-Temporal Relation Network (STRN) to predict fine-grained urban flows. First, a backbone network is used to learn high-level representations for each cell. Second, we present a Global Relation Module (GloNet) that captures global spatial dependencies much more efficiently compared to existing methods.

##### 数据

TAXIBJ HappyValley

- TaxiBJ+: This dataset sources from the trajectories of over 30,000 taxicabs in Beijing for four different time periods (i.e., P1 to P4). Since the taxi distributions and numbers are different in these four time periods, we evaluate our method over these periods separately. As shown in Figure 1(b), we crop the area of interest which contains most traffics, and rasterize this area into 128×128 uniform grid cells. The size of each cell is 150m×150m, which is much more fine-grained than that of the popular datasets like TaxiBJ [41] and MobileBJ [20]. We follow the previous studies [40, 41] to map the GPS points into different grid cells, each of which computes inflow and outflow volumes per half hour.
- HappyValley: It provides open access for the public to observe the hourly human density of a popular theme park in Beijing, allowing us to examine the model capacity in a much smaller area with a higher rate of global transitions. We partition the area into 50×100 grid cells, each of which is around 10m×10m. The human density is more distributed than the taxi flows in TaxiBJ+ since there are several popular play facilities with far more flows than their nearby regions.

we propose the Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (H-STGCN), which is able to “deduce” future travel time by exploiting the data of upcoming traffic volume. Specifically, we propose an algorithm to acquire the upcoming traffic volume from an online navigation engine. Taking advantage of the piecewise-linear flow-density relationship, a novel transformer structure converts the upcoming volume into its equivalent in travel time. We combine this signal with the commonly-utilized travel-time signal, and then apply graph convolution to capture the spatial dependency. Particularly, we construct a compound adjacency matrix which reflects the innate traffic proximity.
