## 背景介绍

### 交通拥堵

- 面临的主要问题

  (T-ZS1) Traffic congestion is a major problem faced by metropolitan cities -> Most congestion mitigation measures are costly, difficult to implement, or both.   
  
  其解决：交通预测
  
  Educated traffic decision made through accurate prediction is a far cheaper and easier to implement alternative for reducing road congestion  

### 交通数据等

- 交通拥挤的代价

  (T-ZS1) In 2015, it is estimated that the avoidable cost of traffic congestion for Australian capital cities is approximately \$16.5 billion, up from the 2010 estimate of \$12.8 billion. Furthermore, this value is estimated to increase to about $30 billion by 2030

Canberra: Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics, 2015.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=zh-CN&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Cosgove%2C+Traffic+and+congestion+cost+trends+for+Australian+capital+cities&btnG=#d=gs_cit&t=1721488944765&u=%2Fscholar%3Fq%3Dinfo%3ACPeX2qr_RW8J%3Ascholar.google.com%2F%26output%3Dcite%26scirp%3D0%26hl%3Dzh-CN)

- 交通监管政策

  (T-ZS1) Singapore implemented regulations on the number of vehicles on roads -> which is infeasible for countries with poor public transportation systems

- 修路成本

  (T-ZS1) the estimated per mile cost of a standard one lane road in New Jersey, USA is $220,490 -> Constructing new roads to ease congestion is also difficult due to the extremely high cost  
  
  > [参考 J. Carnegie and A. M. Voorhees, “The cost of roadway
  > construction, operations and maintenance in new jersey,” pp. 557–566, 2016.  ](https://trid.trb.org/View/1408290)

### 前置条件

- 传感器的普及 -> 大数据获取

  (T-ZS1) With the advancements and widespread adoption of traffic sensors, access to large traffic databases is now available.  -> This has led to the development of traffic prediction as a research field.   
  
- 库 

  Due to the availability of deep neural network libraries such as Keras, PyTorch , and TensorFlow, development of complex neural network models has become much easier  

### 问题定义

#### 交通预测

- 交通预测

  (T-ZS1) 

  描述：

  Future traffic prediction involves creating a prediction model from historical traffic data to predict the short-term future traffic state ranging from 5 to 60 minutes into the future
  
  
  
  特点：
  
  > 交通预测与其他时序分析的不同在于：
  >
  > - 一个地点可能影响另一个地点
  > - 存在全局外部因素如天气、节假日
  
  Traffic prediction is different from conventional time-series analysis in that traffic prediction is subject to spatial as well as many other external factors.  ->  the prediction of traffic at one site depends on the traffic at other sites and all of the sites are affected by external factors such as weather and holidays.  
  
  定义：使用可学习的函数，使用历史交通数据输入，预测未来交通
  
  Traffic prediction concerns the usage of a learnable function that takes as input the historical traffic data from several previous time-steps in order to predict the traffic in the future.  
  
  > 近义句 Traffic prediction is a task of training an arbitrary function to predict future traffic given past traffic data  
  
  - 交通流量 某地某段时间车辆总数
  
    Traffic flow is denoted as the total number of vehicles detected in a target detection site during a certain time period.   
  
  - 交通速度 某地某段时间各车辆平均速度
  
    Traffic speed is denoted as the average traveling speed of vehicles detected in a target detection site during a certain time period  
  
  $$
  \hat y_{t+T'}=f([X_{t-T+1},X_{t-T},\cdots,X_t])
  $$
  
  目标：找到模型参数，最小化误差：
  
  The objective is to find the model parameters which minimize the error between the predicted traffic and the observed traffic:  
  $$
  \theta^*=\arg\min_{\theta^*}L(y_{t+T'},\hat y_{t+T'};\theta^*)
  $$
  
  > 其中 $y_t$ 是时间 $t$ 的观察值，$\hat y_t$ 是预测值，$T$ 是输入序列长度，$T'$ 是预测范围，$L$ 是损失函数，$f$ 是任意函数，$\theta^*$ 是最优参数。
  >
  > - The observed traffic at time $t$
  > - The predicted traffic at time $t$
  > - Input sequence length, i.e., how many time steps of past traffic data are used as the input 
  > - Prediction horizon, i.e., how many time steps in the future the prediction is for 
  > - An arbitrary function that calculates the traffic prediction based on the input data  
  > - Loss function, which is the function that calculates the quality of the prediction
  > - The optimal set of parameters for the function $f$

### 发展历史

#### 概述

(T-ZS1) The earliest class of models used is the classical statistical models. Afterwards, machine learning models improve upon the performance of classical statistical models. Then, the deep neural network class of models dominates the field due to its capability in capturing the complex and nonlinear patterns in traffic data.  

#### 统计模型

> ##### ARIMA

(T-ZS1) classical statistical models, of which the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) family of models is the most popular. 

局限：(T-ZS1) 线性模型，假设数据规律不变；只能预测小时间段，参数手调

- [T-12](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02143) were proposed at a time where traffic data were simpler and much smaller in size  -> a condition that no longer holds true in the present day where the ubiquity of traffic sensors has caused an explosion in traffic flow data   
- [O-1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1996.10473554) the function parameters are manually defined a priori

#### 深度学习

### 常用技术

#### 机器学习

- 局限性：数据密集

  (T-ZS1) The main weakness is that machine learning models are data intensive 

- 局限性：

  (T-ZS1) powerful but very hard to train efficiently  

- 局限性：手动提取特征

  (T-ZS1) many other machine learning models’ feature extraction phase, which helps extract useful patterns and information from the data to help the prediction, is done manually (i.e., using manually tuned kernels)  

- 优点：

  (T-ZS1) Machine learning models are flexible as they can learn from the data. That is, the parameters of the prediction function are adjusted automatically as the model traverses through the dataset  

#### 神经网络

深度神经网络

(T-ZS1) Amongst all the available traffic prediction methods, deep neural network is the most prominent.  

- 概念：

  (T-ZS1) Deep neural networks consist of complex neural network models with a large number of layers. 

- 条件：

  (T-ZS1) increasing computational power, as well as theoretical and software improvements in recent times had made increasingly complex neural network models feasible to train. Thus, in the middle of the 2010s, researchers started to apply deep neural network models for traffic prediction  

- 理由：

  (T-ZS1) This is due to its sheer predictive power that can model the complex and nonlinear traffic patterns

- 类别：
  
  (T-ZS1) The three most common deep neural network models used for traffic prediction are Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Feedforward Neural Networks
  
- 适用理由：CNN/RNN抓时空+层数
  
  (T-ZS1) Some of the deep neural network models can explicitly capture different aspects of traffic data, which made them even more attractive. For instance, CNN can explicitly capture the spatial aspect of traffic data while RNN can explicitly capture the temporal aspect of traffic data. Additionally, the increased number of layers improves the models’ prediction capability. This factor allows them to model traffic fluctuations more accurately  
  
- 优点：自动学习特征
  
  (T-ZS1) (The reason behind its prominence is that) neural networks perform automatic feature extraction as well as the actual prediction in one model 
  
- 局限性：当前状态和未来方向不明

  (T-ZS1) The increasing popularity of deep neural network models for traffic prediction has led to numerous publications, but issues such as the wide variety of hybrid deep neural network structures have made it difficult to assess the current state and future directions of this research field. This problem is compounded by the fact that survey works focusing specifically on deep neural network models are rare
  
- 缺点：

  (T-ZS1) 需要大数据，训练代价高，难以理解(如参数含义)

  - Deep neural network models require a large amount of data that covers all traffic conditions. 

    If the amount of data is too small or if the data is not diverse enough, the model’s generalization capability is compromised.

  - Deep neural network models still take a long time to train. 

    As deep neural network models are complex and have a large number of layers, the training time can be very long. This problem is compounded on hybrid deep neural network models. As classical statistical and older machine learning models are not as complex, their training time is much shorter.

  - Deep neural network models are difficult to interpret. 

    This is because of two reasons: the number of internal parameters is very large, and the parameters are learned from training, not set manually. Thus, while they can predict well, it is hard to understand their parameters. Understanding the parameters may reveal important information such as the spatiotemporal dynamics in the road network

### 评价

- T-ZS3

  (T-ZS1 评价) 分类老旧、深度学习少

  do not include the now ubiquitous deep neural network models

  their work categorized the models based on several criteria such as the type of model (e.g. statistical, neural network, hybrid model) and the problem (e.g. time series, function approximation). This taxonomy is outdated because modern traffic prediction models are mainly based on deep neural network, which under their taxonomy will all fall under the neural network category of model and function approximation category of problem  

- T-ZS4

  (T-ZS1 评价) 分类比较少、没讨论挑战

  their model taxonomy only has a few points of comparison, which are: whether or not the model integrates environmental data, contains spatial property, handles nonlinearity and handles nonstationarity  

  Additionally, their work does not have a future challenges section that discusses how the field can be advanced  

- T-ZS5

  (T-ZS1 评价) 与机器学习关联不大

  their work focuses on big data analytics without much focus on the actual models
